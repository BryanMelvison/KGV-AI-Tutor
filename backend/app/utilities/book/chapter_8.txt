# CHAPTER 8: HOMEOSTASIS AND EXCRETION

## INTRODUCTION
THE KIDNEYS PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN BOTH HOMEOSTASIS AND EXCRETION. THIS CHAPTER EXPLORES THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE KIDNEYS, FOCUSING ON THEIR ROLE IN MAINTAINING INTERNAL BALANCE.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES
BY THE END OF THIS CHAPTER, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO:
- UNDERSTAND THAT HOMEOSTASIS INVOLVES MAINTAINING STABLE INTERNAL CONDITIONS.
- RECOGNIZE CARBON DIOXIDE AND OXYGEN AS WASTE PRODUCTS ELIMINATED THROUGH STOMATA.
- DESCRIBE TEMPERATURE REGULATION MECHANISMS INCLUDING SWEATING, VASOCONSTRICTION, AND VASODILATION.
- IDENTIFY EXCRETORY PRODUCTS FROM LUNGS, KIDNEYS, AND SKIN.

## HOMEOSTASIS
HOMEOSTASIS REFERS TO THE PROCESS OF MAINTAINING STABLE INTERNAL CONDITIONS. THIS INCLUDES REGULATING WATER AND SALT BALANCE, KNOWN AS OSMOREGULATION.

### KEY POINT
THE TERM "HOMEOSTASIS" MEANS MAINTAINING CONSTANT INTERNAL CONDITIONS WITHIN THE BODY.

FOR EXAMPLE, DRINKING WATER AND WAITING AN HOUR RESULTS IN URINE PRODUCTION MATCHING THE INTAKE, ILLUSTRATING HOMEOSTATIC BALANCE.

## WATER BALANCE
WATER IS GAINED THROUGH DRINKING, FOOD, AND METABOLIC PROCESSES. IT IS LOST VIA URINE, SWEAT, FECES, AND EXHALED AIR. DAILY GAINS AND LOSSES BALANCE, PRESERVING INTERNAL STABILITY.

## INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT
THE INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT CONSISTS OF BLOOD AND TISSUE FLUID SURROUNDING CELLS, ESSENTIAL FOR CELL FUNCTION AND HOMEOSTASIS.

## CONCLUSION
UNDERSTANDING HOMEOSTASIS AND KIDNEY FUNCTION IS CRUCIAL FOR GRASPING HOW THE BODY MAINTAINS BALANCE AGAINST ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES. THE KIDNEYS FILTER BLOOD, REMOVE WASTE, AND REGULATE WATER AND SOLUTES, ENSURING INTERNAL STABILITY.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: HOMEOSTASIS AND EXCRETION

## WATER BALANCE IN ADULTS

MAINTAINING A BALANCE BETWEEN WATER GAIN AND LOSS IS ESSENTIAL FOR HOMEOSTASIS IN ADULTS. AN ADULT TYPICALLY GAINS APPROXIMATELY 2600 CM³ OF WATER DAILY THROUGH FOOD, DRINKING, AND CELL RESPIRATION. THIS GAIN IS OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, PRIMARILY THROUGH EXHALED AIR, SWEAT, URINE, AND FAECES, EACH CONTRIBUTING TO A TOTAL LOSS OF ABOUT 2600 CM³.

UNDERSTANDING THESE PROCESSES IS CRUCIAL FOR PRESERVING THE BODY'S INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT, WHICH RELIES ON PRECISE REGULATION OF WATER LEVELS TO ENSURE OPTIMAL CELLULAR FUNCTION.

## TISSUE FLUID

TISSUE FLUID, A CLEAR LIQUID SURROUNDING CELLS, PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN NUTRIENT EXCHANGE AND WASTE REMOVAL. IT FORMS FROM PLASMA LEAKAGE THROUGH CAPILLARIES AND MIRRORS BLOOD PLASMA COMPOSITION, EXCLUDING PROTEINS. THIS FLUID MAINTAINS CELLS IN AN OPTIMAL ENVIRONMENT BY REGULATING SOLUTE CONCENTRATION, PH, AND TEMPERATURE, ENSURING CELLULAR INTEGRITY.

---

## HOMEOSTASIS AND SOLUTE BALANCE

HOMEOSTASIS IS PRESERVED BY PRECISE REGULATION OF TISSUE FLUID COMPOSITION. EXCESS IONS SUCH AS SODIUM, POTASSIUM, PHOSPHATE, AND AMMONIUM ARE REMOVED THROUGH URINE TO PREVENT TOXICITY. THIS PROCESS ENSURES THE BLOOD AND TISSUE FLUID REMAIN STABLE, ALLOWING CELLS TO FUNCTION OPTIMALLY WITHOUT DEHYDRATION OR SWELLING.

---

## URINE PRODUCTION AND COMPOSITION

ADULTS PRODUCE APPROXIMATELY 1.5 DM³ OF URINE DAILY, VARYING WITH HYDRATION LEVELS. EACH LITRE CONTAINS ABOUT 40 GRAMS OF WASTE PRODUCTS AND SALTS, INCLUDING SODIUM, POTASSIUM, CHLORIDE, PHOSPHATE, AMMONIUM, UREA, AND WATER. THIS EFFICIENT EXCRETORY SYSTEM PREVENTS THE BUILDUP OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES, MAINTAINING A STABLE INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT.

---

## CONCLUSION

THE INTRICATE BALANCE OF WATER INTAKE AND OUTPUT, ALONG WITH THE DYNAMIC REGULATION OF TISSUE FLUID COMPOSITION, IS VITAL FOR LIFE. UNDERSTANDING THESE PROCESSES UNDERSCORES THE IMPORTANCE OF HOMEOSTASIS IN MAINTAINING HEALTH AND CELLULAR FUNCTION.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: HOMEOSTASIS AND EXCRETION

## KEY POINTS

EXCRETION IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH WASTE PRODUCTS OF METABOLISM ARE REMOVED FROM THE BODY. IN HUMANS, THE PRIMARY NITROGENOUS EXCRETORY SUBSTANCE IS UREA. UREA IS AN EXCRETORY PRODUCT OF THE KIDNEYS, WHILE CARBON DIOXIDE, PRODUCED BY CELL RESPIRATION, IS EXCRETED BY THE LUNGS. THE HUMAN SKIN ALSO FUNCTIONS AS AN EXCRETORY ORGAN, AS SWEAT CONTAINS SMALL AMOUNTS OF UREA.

## NITROGENOUS WASTE

NITROGENOUS WASTE REFERS TO SUBSTANCES CONTAINING NITROGEN, SUCH AS UREA AND AMMONIA. ALL ANIMALS MUST EXCRETE NITROGENOUS WASTE BECAUSE PROTEINS, WHICH CONTAIN NITROGEN, CANNOT BE STORED IN THE BODY. EXCESS PROTEINS ARE BROKEN DOWN IN THE LIVER INTO AMINO ACIDS, LEADING TO THE FORMATION OF UREA, WHICH IS THEN FILTERED BY THE KIDNEYS DURING URINE FORMATION.

## EXCRETION VS. DIGESTION

EXCRETION AND DIGESTION ARE DISTINCT PROCESSES. WHEN THE BODY ELIMINATES SOLID WASTE FROM THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM (FAECES), THIS IS NOT CONSIDERED EXCRETION. FAECES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF UNDIGESTED FOOD, BACTERIA, AND DEAD CELLS, RATHER THAN METABOLIC WASTE.

## THE ROLE OF THE KIDNEYS

THE KIDNEYS SERVE TWO MAIN FUNCTIONS: THEY ACT AS HOMEOSTATIC ORGANS, REGULATING WATER AND SALT CONCENTRATION IN THE BODY, AND FUNCTION AS EXCRETORY ORGANS, CONCENTRATING NITROGENOUS WASTE FOR ELIMINATION.

## CONTROL OF BODY TEMPERATURE

MAMMALS AND BIRDS ARE WARM-BLOODED ORGANISMS THAT MAINTAIN A CONSTANT INTERNAL TEMPERATURE. FOR EXAMPLE, HUMAN BODY TEMPERATURE IS TYPICALLY AROUND 37°C. IN CONTRAST, REPTILES ARE COLD-BLOODED; THEIR BODY TEMPERATURE MATCHES THEIR ENVIRONMENT, FLUCTUATING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES.

### BEHAVIORAL ADAPTATIONS

IN THE WILD, LIZARDS EXHIBIT BEHAVIORAL ADAPTATIONS TO REGULATE BODY TEMPERATURE. THEY MAY BASK IN SUNLIGHT TO WARM UP OR SEEK SHADE TO COOL DOWN, REFLECTING THEIR NEED TO MAINTAIN THERMAL BALANCE.

## SUMMARY OF URINE COMPOSITION

URINE IS COMPOSED PRIMARILY OF WATER AND CONTAINS SEVERAL SUBSTANCES: UREA (23.3 G PER DM³), AMMONIA (0.4 G PER DM³), OTHER NITROGENOUS WASTE (1.6 G PER DM³), SODIUM CHLORIDE (10.0 G PER DM³), POTASSIUM (1.3 G PER DM³), AND PHOSPHATE (2.3 G PER DM³).

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

UNDERSTANDING EXCRETION AND HOMEOSTASIS IS ESSENTIAL FOR GRASPING HOW ANIMALS, INCLUDING HUMANS, MAINTAIN INTERNAL BALANCE AND ELIMINATE WASTE PRODUCTS. THIS PROCESS ENSURES THE BODY FUNCTIONS OPTIMALLY UNDER VARIOUS CONDITIONS.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: HOMEOSTASIS AND EXCRETION

## UNDERSTANDING PHYSIOLOGY
PHYSIOLOGY IS THE STUDY OF HOW LIVING ORGANISMS FUNCTION. IT EXAMINES PROCESSES SUCH AS MUSCLE CONTRACTION, NERVE SIGNALING, AND PLANT TRANSPIRATION.

## HOMEOTHERMS VS. OTHER ANIMALS
HOMEOTHERMIC ANIMALS, LIKE MAMMALS AND BIRDS, MAINTAIN A STABLE INTERNAL TEMPERATURE THROUGH SPECIFIC MECHANISMS. IN CONTRAST, ECTOTHERMIC ANIMALS RELY ON EXTERNAL TEMPERATURES FOR REGULATION.

### ENDOTHERMS
ENDOTHERMS GENERATE BODY HEAT FROM CHEMICAL REACTIONS. THEY REGULATE HEAT LOSS VIA SWEATING AND BLOOD FLOW ADJUSTMENTS. BEHAVIORAL STRATEGIES, SUCH AS HUDDLING (PENGUINS) OR WEARING CLOTHING (HUMANS), AID IN TEMPERATURE CONTROL.

## IMPORTANCE OF BODY TEMPERATURE
HUMANS REQUIRE A CORE TEMPERATURE AROUND 37°C FOR OPTIMAL ENZYME FUNCTION. THIS STABILITY ALLOWS METABOLISM TO OPERATE CONSISTENTLY, PREVENTING SLOWDOWNS IN COLD ENVIRONMENTS.

### ENZYME FUNCTION
ENZYMES, WHICH ARE PROTEINS, FUNCTION BEST AT 37°C. HIGHER TEMPERATURES CAN DENATURE THEM, REDUCING THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. ENDOTHERMS HAVE EVOLVED ENZYMES SUITED FOR THEIR BODY TEMPERATURE, TYPICALLY AROUND 40°C.

## BODY TEMPERATURE OF VARIOUS SPECIES
THE FOLLOWING TABLE LISTS AVERAGE AND NORMAL BODY TEMPERATURES FOR SEVERAL MAMMALS AND BIRDS:

| SPECIES        | AVERAGE BODY TEMPERATURE (°C) |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| BROWN BEAR     | 38.0 ± 1.0                    |
| CAMEL          | 37.5 ± 0.5                    |
| ELEPHANT       | 36.2 ± 0.5                    |
| FOX            | 38.8 ± 1.3                    |
| HUMAN          | 36.9 ± 0.7                    |
| MOUSE          | 39.3 ± 1.3                    |
| POLAR BEAR     | 37.5 ± 0.4                    |

## MONITORING BODY TEMPERATURE
IN MAMMALS, THE HYPOTHALAMUS REGULATES CORE TEMPERATURE THROUGH A THERMOREGULATORY CENTER. THIS SYSTEM ADJUSTS BEHAVIOR AND PHYSIOLOGY TO MAINTAIN HOMEOSTASIS.

### RESPONSE TO TEMPERATURE CHANGES
WHEN EXPOSED TO EXTREME TEMPERATURES, INDIVIDUALS MAY EXHIBIT BEHAVIORS LIKE SEEKING SHADE OR INCREASING CLOTHING IN COLD CONDITIONS. IF THESE ACTIONS ARE INSUFFICIENT, PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES, SUCH AS ALTERING BLOOD FLOW, OCCUR TO MAINTAIN STABILITY.

## OBSERVING TEMPERATURE EFFECTS
GOLDFISH ACTIVITY INCREASES WITH WARMER WATER BUT DECREASES AS TEMPERATURES DROP, ILLUSTRATING THE IMPACT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS ON ECTOTHERMIC ORGANISMS.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: HOMEOSTASIS AND EXCRETION

## THE SKIN AND TEMPERATURE CONTROL

THE HUMAN SKIN PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN MAINTAINING HOMEOSTASIS, PARTICULARLY IN REGULATING BODY TEMPERATURE. IT SERVES SEVERAL IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING PROTECTING THE BODY FROM MECHANICAL DAMAGE, ACTING AS A BARRIER TO PREVENT PATHOGEN ENTRY, RETAINING WATER, FUNCTIONING AS A SENSORY ORGAN FOR TOUCH AND TEMPERATURE CHANGES, AND CONTROLLING HEAT LOSS.

### STRUCTURE OF HUMAN SKIN

HUMAN SKIN IS COMPOSED OF THREE MAIN LAYERS:

1. **EPIDERMIS**: THE OUTERMOST LAYER, CONSISTING OF DEAD CELLS THAT PREVENT WATER LOSS AND PROTECT AGAINST MICROORGANISMS.
2. **DERMIS**: THE MIDDLE LAYER, WHICH CONTAINS SENSORY RECEPTORS, SWEAT GLANDS, SMALL BLOOD VESSELS, AND HAIR FOLLICLES.
3. **HYPODERMIS**: THE INNERMOST LAYER, MADE UP OF FATTY TISSUE THAT INSULATES THE BODY AND SERVES AS AN ENERGY RESERVE.

THE STRUCTURE OF HUMAN SKIN INCLUDES VARIOUS COMPONENTS SUCH AS PORES, HAIR, OIL GLANDS, AND SENSORY RECEPTORS.

### TEMPERATURE REGULATION PROCESS

WHEN THE HYPOTHALAMUS DETECTS AN INCREASE IN CORE BODY TEMPERATURE, IT INITIATES A SERIES OF RESPONSES TO COOL THE BODY DOWN. THIS PROCESS INVOLVES INCREASED SWEAT PRODUCTION BY SWEAT GLANDS, WITH SWEAT BEING SECRETED ONTO THE SKIN'S SURFACE. EVAPORATION OF SWEAT ABSORBS HEAT FROM THE BODY, COOLING THE SKIN AND REQUIRING ENERGY FOR THE PHASE CHANGE KNOWN AS LATENT HEAT OF VAPORIZATION.

A THERMOSTAT IS A DEVICE THAT REGULATES TEMPERATURE BY SWITCHING ON OR OFF IN RESPONSE TO TEMPERATURE CHANGES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN AN IRON, A THERMOSTAT CAN BE SET TO 'HOT' OR 'COOL' TO MAINTAIN THE APPROPRIATE TEMPERATURE FOR DIFFERENT MATERIALS DURING IRONING.

BY UNDERSTANDING THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE SKIN, WE APPRECIATE HOW OUR BODIES MAINTAIN A STABLE INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT DESPITE VARYING EXTERNAL CONDITIONS.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: HOMEOSTASIS AND EXCRETION

HOMEOSTASIS IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH AN ORGANISM MAINTAINS A STABLE INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT DESPITE EXTERNAL CHANGES. A KEY ASPECT OF HOMEOSTASIS IS TEMPERATURE REGULATION, ESSENTIAL FOR ENZYME FUNCTION AND METABOLIC PROCESSES.

## MECHANISMS OF TEMPERATURE REGULATION

### SWEATING
WHEN BODY TEMPERATURE RISES, SWEATING OCCURS AS A PRIMARY RESPONSE. SWEAT IS SECRETED AT BODY TEMPERATURE, COOLING THE SKIN AS IT EVAPORATES. HOWEVER, IN HIGH HUMIDITY, SUCH AS IN TROPICAL RAINFORESTS, SWEAT EVAPORATION IS LIMITED, REDUCING COOLING EFFICIENCY.

### HAIR ERECTION
IN COLD CONDITIONS, HAIR ERECTOR MUSCLES CONTRACT, RAISING HAIRS TO TRAP AIR AND RETAIN HEAT. IN WARM CONDITIONS, HAIRS LIE FLAT, ALLOWING INCREASED HEAT LOSS. THIS MECHANISM IS PROMINENT IN HAIRY MAMMALS LIKE CATS AND DOGS, AND BIRDS USE SIMILAR FEATHER FLUFFING.

### BLOOD FLOW REGULATION
THE BODY REGULATES TEMPERATURE THROUGH VASODILATION AND VASOCONSTRICTION:

- **VASODILATION** WIDENS ARTERIOLES, INCREASING BLOOD FLOW TO THE SKIN'S SURFACE, ENHANCING HEAT LOSS.
- **VASOCONSTRICTION** REDUCES BLOOD FLOW, MINIMIZING HEAT LOSS. THESE PROCESSES ARE CONTROLLED BY SPHINCTER MUSCLES IN ARTERIOLE WALLS.

### METABOLIC RESPONSES
IN COLD CONDITIONS, METABOLISM INCREASES, GENERATING HEAT. THE LIVER PLAYS A ROLE, AND ADRENALINE STIMULATES METABOLIC ACTIVITY. SHIVERING, WHERE MUSCLES RAPIDLY CONTRACT AND RELAX, PRODUCES HEAT.

## SUMMARY OF TEMPERATURE REGULATION

THE BODY MAINTAINS TEMPERATURE AROUND 37°C THROUGH MECHANISMS INCLUDING SWEATING, VASODILATION, VASOCONSTRICTION, HAIR ERECTION, SHIVERING, AND METABOLIC INCREASES. BEHAVIORAL ACTIONS LIKE SEEKING SHADE OR WEARING CLOTHING AID REGULATION. SIGNIFICANT DEVIATIONS MAY INDICATE HEALTH ISSUES, SUCH AS FEVER AT 39°C.

THIS COMPLEX SYSTEM ENSURES INTERNAL STABILITY DESPITE EXTERNAL CHANGES.
