# 8 HOMEOSTASIS AND EXCRETION

The kidneys have major roles to play in both homeostasis and excretion. This chapter is mainly concerned with the structure and function of the kidneys. It also deals with another important aspect of homeostasis – maintaining a steady body temperature.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

- Understand that homeostasis is the maintenance of a constant internal environment
- Understand that control of body water content and body temperature are examples of homeostasis
- Know the excretory products of the lungs, kidneys and skin
- Understand the origin of carbon dioxide and oxygen as waste products of metabolism and their loss from the stomata of a leaf
- Describe the role of the skin in temperature regulation, with reference to sweating, vasoconstriction and vasodilation

Inside our bodies, conditions are kept relatively constant. This is called **homeostasis**. The kidneys are organs which have a major role to play in both homeostasis and in the removal of waste products, or **excretion**. They filter the blood, removing substances and controlling the concentration of water and solutes (dissolved substances) in the blood and other body fluids.

## HOMEOSTASIS

| KEY POINT |
|-----------|
| The meaning of 'homeostasis' is 'keeping the conditions in the internal environment of the body relatively constant'. One aspect of homeostasis is the maintenance of the water and salt content of the internal environment. This is called osmoregulation. |

If you were to drink a litre of water and wait for half an hour, your body would soon respond to this change by producing about the same volume of urine. In other words, it would automatically balance your water input and water loss. Drinking is the main way that our bodies gain water, but there are other sources (Figure 8.1). Some water is present in the food that we eat, and a small amount is formed by cell respiration. The body also loses water, mostly in urine, but also smaller volumes in sweat, faeces and exhaled air. Every day, we gain and lose about the same volume of water, so that the total content of our bodies stays more or less the same. This is an example of homeostasis. The word 'homeostasis' means 'steady state', and refers to keeping conditions inside the body relatively constant.

The inside of the body is known as the **internal environment**. You have probably heard of the 'environment', which means the 'surroundings' of an organism. The internal environment is the surroundings of the cells inside the body. It particularly means the blood, together with another liquid called **tissue fluid**.

| Water Gain        | Amount    | Water Loss        | Amount    |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Food              | 800 cm³   | Exhaled air       | 400 cm³   |
| Drink             | 1400 cm³  | Sweat             | 600 cm³   |
| Cell respiration  | 400 cm³   | Urine             | 1500 cm³  |
|                   |           | Faeces            | 100 cm³   |
| Total             | 2600 cm³  | Total             | 2600 cm³  |

Tissue fluid is a watery solution of salts, glucose and other solutes. It surrounds all the cells of the body, forming a pathway for the transfer of nutrients between the blood and the cells. Tissue fluid is formed by leakage from blood capillaries. It is similar in composition to blood plasma, but lacks the plasma proteins.

It is not just water and salts that are kept constant in the body. Many other components of the internal environment are maintained. For example, the level of carbon dioxide in the blood is regulated, along with the blood pH, the concentration of dissolved glucose (see Chapter 7) and the body temperature.

Homeostasis is important because cells will only function properly if they are bathed in a tissue fluid which provides them with their optimum conditions. For instance, if the tissue fluid contains too many solutes, the cells will lose water by osmosis, and become dehydrated. If the tissue fluid is too dilute, the cells will swell up with water. Both conditions will prevent them working efficiently and might cause permanent damage. If the pH of the tissue fluid is not correct, it will affect the activity of the cell's enzymes, as will a body temperature much different from 37 °C. It is also important that excretory products are removed. Substances such as urea must be prevented from building up in the blood and tissue fluid, where they would be toxic to cells.

### DID YOU KNOW?
'Salts' in urine or in the blood are present as ions. For example, the sodium chloride in Table 8.1 will be in solution as sodium ions (Na+) and chloride ions (Cl-). Urine contains many other ions, such as potassium (K+), phosphate (HPO₄²⁻) and ammonium (NH₄+), and removes excess ions from the blood.

## URINE

An adult human produces about 1.5 dm³ of urine every day, although this volume depends very much on the amount of water drunk and the volume lost in other forms, such as sweat. Every litre of urine contains about 40g of waste products and salts (Table 8.1).

The real difference between homeotherms and all other animals is that homeotherms can keep their temperatures constant by using physiological changes for generating or losing heat. For this reason, mammals and birds are also called 'endotherms', meaning 'heat from inside'.

An endotherm uses heat from the chemical reactions in its cells to warm its body. It then controls its heat loss by regulating processes like sweating and blood flow through the skin. Endotherms use behavioural ways to control their temperature too. For example, penguins 'huddle' together in groups to keep warm, and humans put on extra clothes in winter.

What is the advantage of a human maintaining a body temperature of 37°C? It means that all the chemical reactions taking place in the cells of the body can go on at a steady, predictable rate. The metabolism doesn't slow down in cold environments. If you watch goldfish in a garden pond, you will notice that in summer, when the pond water is warm, they are very active, swimming about quickly. In winter, when the temperature drops, the fish slow down and become very sluggish in their actions. This would happen to a mammal too, if its body temperature varied.

It is also important that the body does not become too hot. The cells' enzymes work best at 37°C. At higher temperatures enzymes, like all proteins, are destroyed by denaturing (see Chapter 1). Endotherms have all evolved a body temperature of around 40°C (Table 8.2) and enzymes that work best at this temperature.

## MONITORING BODY TEMPERATURE

In humans and other mammals the core body temperature is monitored by a part of the brain called the thermoregulatory centre. This is located in the hypothalamus of the brain. It acts as the body's 'thermostat'.

If a person goes into a warm or cold environment, the first thing that happens is that temperature receptors in the skin send electrical impulses to the hypothalamus, which stimulates the brain to alter our behaviour. We start to feel hot or cold, and usually do something about it, such as finding shade, having a cold drink, or putting on more clothes.

If changes to our behaviour are not enough to keep our body temperature constant, the thermoregulatory centre in the hypothalamus detects a change in the temperature of the blood flowing through it. It then sends signals via nerves to other organs of the body, which regulate the temperature by physiological means.

                                         DID YOU KNOW?
                                         A thermostat is a switch that is turned on or off by a change in
                                         temperature. It is used in electrical appliances to keep their temperature
                                         steady. For example, a thermostat in an iron can be set to 'hot' or 'cool'
                                         to keep the temperature of the iron set for ironing different materials:

THE SKIN AND TEMPERATURE               The human skin has a number of functions related to the fact that it forms the
CONTROL                                outer surface of the body: These include:
                                          forming a tough outer layer able to resist mechanical damage
                                          acting as a barrier to theentryof pathogens
                                          forming an impermeable surface, preventing loss of water
                                          acting as a sense organ for touch and temperature changes
                                          controlling the loss of heat through the body surface.
                                       Figure 8.3 shows the structure of human skin: It is made up of three layers: the
                                       epidermis, dermis and hypodermis_
                                                                 pore                                               hair

                       Figure 8.3 A section through human skin
                                       The outer epidermis consists of dead cells that stop water loss and protect the
                                       body against invasion by microorganisms such as bacteria The hypodermis
                                       contains fatty tissue, which insulates the body against heat loss and is a store
                                       of energy: The middle layer; the dermis, contains many sensory receptors. It is
                                       also the location of sweat glands and many small blood vessels, as well as hair
                                       follicles. These last three structures are involved in temperature control
                                       Imagine that the hypothalamus detects a rise in the central (core) body
                                       temperature. Immediately it sends nerve impulses to the skin. These bring
                                       about changes to correct the rise in temperature_
                                       First of all, the sweat glands produce greater amounts of sweat: This liquid
                                       is secreted onto the surface of the skin: When a liquid evaporates it turns into
                                         gas. This change needs energy, called the latent heat of vaporisation: When
---
sweat evaporates, the energy is supplied by the body's heat, cooling the body
down. It is not that the sweat is cool - it is secreted at body temperature. It
only has a cooling action when it evaporates. In very humid atmospheres (e.g.
a tropical rainforest) the sweat stays on the skin and doesn't evaporate. It then
has very little cooling effect.

Secondly, hairs on the surface of the skin lie flat against the skin's surface.
This happens because of the relaxation of tiny muscles called hair erector
muscles attached to the base of each hair. In cold conditions, these contract
and the hairs are pulled upright. The hairs trap a layer of air next to the skin, and
since air is a poor conductor of heat, this acts as insulation. In warm conditions,
the thinner layer of trapped air means that more heat will be lost. This is not
very effective in humans, because the hairs over most of our body do not grow
very large. It is very effective in hairy mammals like cats or dogs. The same
principle is used by birds, which 'fluff out' their feathers in cold weather.

Lastly, there are tiny blood vessels called capillary loops in the dermis. Blood
flows through these loops, radiating heat to the outside, and cooling the body
down. If the body is too hot, arterioles (small arteries) leading to the capillary
loops dilate (widen). This increases the blood flow to the skin's surface
(Figure 8.4) and is called vasodilation.

| Vasodilation | Vasoconstriction |
|--------------|------------------|
| More heat radiated | Less heat radiated |
| Capillary loops in skin visible | Capillary loops less visible |
| Blood vessels dilate | Blood vessels constrict |
| Blood flows through surface vessels | Blood flows through deeper vessels |

Figure 8.4 Blood flow through the surface of the skin is controlled by vasodilation or
vasoconstriction.

In cold conditions, the opposite happens. The arterioles leading to the surface
capillary loops constrict (become narrower) and blood flow to the surface of
the skin is reduced, so that less heat is lost. This is called vasoconstriction.
Vasoconstriction and vasodilation are brought about by tiny rings of muscles
in the walls of the arterioles, called sphincter muscles, like the sphincters you
read about earlier in this chapter, at the outlet of the bladder.

There are other ways that the body can control heat loss and heat gain. In cold
conditions, the body's metabolism speeds up, generating more heat. The liver,
a large organ, can produce a lot of metabolic heat in this way. The hormone
adrenaline stimulates the increase in metabolism (see Chapter 7). Shivering
also takes place, where the muscles contract and relax rapidly. This also
generates a large amount of heat.

Sweating, vasodilation and vasoconstriction, hair erection, shivering and
changes to the metabolism, along with behavioural actions, work together to
keep the body temperature to within a few tenths of a degree of the 'normal'
37 °C. If the difference is any bigger than this it shows that something is wrong.
For instance, a temperature of 39 °C might be due to an illness.
