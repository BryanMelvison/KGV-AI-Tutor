## 2 THE VARIETY OF LIVING ORGANISMS

There is an enormous variety of living organisms. Biologists put them into groups according to their structure and function. The members of each group have certain features in common.

### LEARNING OBJECTIVES

- Understand the difference between eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms
- Describe the features common to plants and recognise examples of flowering plants such as maize, peas and beans
- Describe the features common to animals and recognise examples such as mammals and insects
- Describe the features common to fungi and recognise examples such as Mucor and yeast
- Describe the features common to protoctists and recognise examples such as Amoeba, Chlorella and Plasmodium
- Describe the features common to bacteria and recognise examples such as Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Pneumococcus
- Describe the features common to viruses and recognise examples such as the influenza virus, the HIV virus and the tobacco mosaic virus
- Understand the term 'pathogen' and know that pathogens may include fungi, bacteria, protoctists or viruses.

There are more than ten million species of organisms alive on Earth today, and many more that once lived on Earth but are now extinct. In order to make sense of this enormous variety biologists classify organisms, putting them into groups. Members of each group are related – they are descended from a common ancestor by the process of evolution (see Chapter 19). This common ancestry is reflected in the similarities of structure and function of the members of a group.

The five major groups of living organisms are plants, animals, fungi, protoctists and bacteria.

### PLANTS

You will be familiar with flowering plants, such as those shown in Figure 2.1. This group, or kingdom, also contains simpler plants, such as mosses and ferns. All plants are multicellular, which means that their 'bodies' are made up of many cells. Their main distinguishing feature is that their cells contain chloroplasts and they carry out photosynthesis – the process that uses light energy to convert simple inorganic molecules such as water and carbon dioxide into complex organic compounds (see Chapter 10). One of these organic compounds is the carbohydrate cellulose, and all plants have cell walls made of this material.

Plants can make many other organic compounds as a result of photosynthesis. One of the first to be made is the storage carbohydrate starch, which is often found inside plant cells. Another is the sugar sucrose, which is transported around the plant and is sometimes stored in fruits and other plant organs. The structure and function of flowering plants is dealt with in Unit 3 of this book.

Figure 2.1 (a) A pea plant. Its leaves and stem cells contain chloroplasts, giving them their green colour. The white flowers are pollinated by insects. (b) Maize plants are pollinated by wind. These are the male flowers, which make the pollen. (c) The female maize flowers produce seeds after pollination.

## ANIMALS

You will be even more familiar with this kingdom, since it contains the species Homo sapiens, i.e. humans! The variety of the animal kingdom is also enormous, including organisms such as sponges, molluscs, worms, starfish, insects and crustaceans, through to larger animals such as fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals (Figure 2.2). The last five groups are all vertebrates, which means that they have a vertebral column, or backbone. All other animals lack this feature, and are called invertebrates.

Figure 2.2 (a) A housefly. (b) A mosquito, feeding on human blood. Houseflies and mosquitoes are both insects, which make up the largest sub-group of all the animals. About 60% of all animal species are insects. (c) This high jumper's movement is coordinated by a complex nervous system.

Animals are also multicellular organisms. Their cells never contain chloroplasts, so they are unable to carry out photosynthesis. Instead, they gain their nutrition by feeding on other animals or plants. Animal cells also lack cell walls, which allows their cells to change shape, an important feature for organisms that need to move from place to place. Movement in animals is achieved in various ways, but often involves coordination by a nervous system (see Chapter 6). Another feature common to most animals is that they store carbohydrate in their cells as a compound called glycogen (see Chapter 4). The structure and function of animals is dealt with in Unit 2 of this book.

## FUNGI

Fungi include mushrooms and toadstools, as well as moulds. These groups of fungi are multicellular. Another group of fungi is the yeasts, which are unicellular (made of single cells). Different species of yeasts live everywhere – on the surface of fruits, in soil, water, and even on dust in the air. The yeast powder used for baking contains millions of yeast cells (Figure 2.3). The cells of fungi never contain chloroplasts, so they cannot photosynthesise. Their cells have cell walls, but they are not composed of cellulose (Figure 2.4).

### EXTENSION WORK

Because fungi have cell walls, they were once thought to be plants that had lost their chlorophyll. We now know that their cell wall is not made of cellulose as in plants, but of a different chemical called chitin (the same material that makes up the outside skeleton of insects). There are many ways that fungi are very different from plants (the most obvious is that fungi do not photosynthesise) and they are not closely related to plants at all.

     KEY POINT                               A mushroom or toadstool is the reproductive structure of the organism; called
     The singular of hyphae is hypha:         fruiting body (Figure 2.5) . Under the soil, the mushroom has many fine
                                             thread-like filaments called hyphae (pronounced high-fee): A mould is rather
                                             like a mushroom without the fruiting body. It just consists of the network of
                                             hyphae (Figure 2.6). The whole network is called a mycelium (pronounced
                                             my-sea-lee-um): Moulds feed by absorbing nutrients from dead (or sometimes
                                             living) material, so they are found wherever this is present; for example; in soil,

                                             The thread-Iike hyphae of Mucor have cell walls surrounding their cytoplasm_
                                             The cytoplasm contains many nuclei. In other words the hyphae are not
                                             divided up into separate cells_
                                             When a spore from Mucor lands on the food, a hypha grows out from it: The
                                             hypha grows and branches again and again, until the mycelium covers the
                                             surface of the food: The hyphae secrete digestive enzymes on to the food,
                                             breaking it down into soluble substances such as sugars, which are then
                                             absorbed by the mould. Eventually; the food is used up and the mould must
                                             infect another source of food by producing more spores_
                                             When anorganism feeds on dead organic material in this way, and digestion
                                             takes place outside of the organism, this is called saprotrophic nutrition:
                                             Enzymes that are secreted out of cells for this purpose are called extracellular
                                             enzymes (see Chapter 1).

# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES: THE VARIETY OF LIVING ORGANISMS

## PROTOCTISTS

Protoctists are sometimes called the 'dustbin kingdom', because they are a mixed group of organisms that don't fit into the plants, animals or fungi. Most protoctists are microscopic single-celled organisms (Figure 2.8). Some look like animal cells, such as Amoeba, which lives in pond water. These are known as protozoa. Other protoctists have chloroplasts and carry out photosynthesis, so are more like plants. These are called algae. Most algae are unicellular, but some species such as seaweeds are multicellular and can grow to a great size. Some protoctists are the agents of disease, such as Plasmodium, the organism that causes malaria.

## EUKARYOTIC AND PROKARYOTIC ORGANISMS

All the organisms described so far are composed of eukaryotic cells and are known as eukaryotic organisms. 'Eukaryotic' means 'having a nucleus' – their cells contain a nucleus surrounded by a membrane, along with other membrane bound organelles, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts.

There are also organisms made of simpler cells, which have no nucleus, mitochondria or chloroplasts. These are called prokaryotic cells. 'Prokaryotic' means 'before nucleus'. The main forms of prokaryotic organisms are the bacteria.

## BACTERIA

Bacteria are small single-celled organisms. Their cells are much smaller than those of eukaryotic organisms and have a much simpler structure. To give you some idea of their size, a typical animal cell might be 10 to 50μm in diameter (1 μm, or one micrometre, is a millionth of a metre). Compared with this, a typical bacterium is only 1 to 5μm in length (Figure 2.9) and its volume is thousands of times smaller than that of the animal cell.

There are three basic shapes of bacteria: spheres, rods and spirals, but they all have a similar internal structure (Figure 2.10).

All bacteria are surrounded by a cell wall, which protects the bacterium and keeps the shape of the cell. Bacterial cell walls are not made of cellulose but a complex compound of sugars and proteins called peptidoglycan. Some species have another layer outside this wall, called a capsule or slime layer. Both give the bacterium extra protection. Underneath the cell wall is the cell membrane, as in other cells. The middle of the cell is made of cytoplasm. Since it is a prokaryotic cell, the bacterium has no nucleus. Instead, its genetic material (DNA) is in a single chromosome, loose in the cytoplasm, forming a circular loop.

Figure 2.9 A bacterium is much smaller than an animal cell. The relative size of a virus is also shown.

| Component | Size |
|-----------|------|
| Animal cell | Largest |
| Bacterium | Much smaller than animal cell |
| Virus | Smallest (shown for scale) |

| Component | Description |

| cell wall | Outermost layer |
| cell surface membrane | Just inside the cell wall |
| chromosome (nucleoid) | DNA material in the center |
| capsule (slime layer) | Surrounding the cell |
| plasmids | Small circular rings of DNA |
| flagellum | Propulsion structure |

Scale: 1 μm

Some bacteria can swim, propelled through water by corkscrew-like movements of structures called flagella (a single one is called a flagellum). However, many bacteria do not have flagella and cannot move by themselves. Other structures present in the cytoplasm include the plasmids. These are small circular rings of DNA, carrying some of the bacterium's genes. Not all bacteria contain plasmids, although about three-quarters of all known species do. Plasmids have very important uses in genetic engineering (see Chapter 21).

### KEY POINT

Pathogens are organisms that cause disease. Many common animal and plant diseases are caused by bacteria or viruses. Most protoctists are free-living, but a few species are pathogens, such as Plasmodium (Figure 2.8). Even some species of fungi can cause disease, e.g. the skin infection called 'athlete's foot' is caused by a mould.

Some bacteria contain a form of chlorophyll in their cytoplasm, and can carry out photosynthesis. However, most bacteria feed off other living or dead organisms. Along with the fungi, many bacteria are important decomposers (see Chapter 14), recycling dead organisms and waste products in the soil and elsewhere. Some bacteria are used by humans to make food, such as Lactobacillus bulgaricus, a rod-shaped species used in the production of yoghurt from milk (Figure 2.11). Other species are pathogens, which means that they cause disease (Figure 2.12).

Despite the relatively simple structure of the bacterial cell, it is still a living cell that carries out the normal processes of life, such as respiration, feeding, excretion, growth and reproduction. As you have seen, some bacteria can move, and they can also respond to a range of stimuli. For example, they may move towards a source of food, or away from a poisonous chemical. You should think about these features when you compare bacteria with the next group, the much simpler viruses.

Figure 2.11 The bacterium Lactobacillus bulgaricus, used in the production of yoghurt.

## VIRUSES

All viruses are parasites, and can only reproduce inside living cells. The cell in which the virus lives is called the host. There are many different types of viruses. Some live in the cells of animals or plants, and there are even viruses which infect bacteria. Viruses are much smaller than bacterial cells: most are between 0.01 and 0.1 μm in diameter (Figure 2.9).

Viruses are not made of cells. A virus particle is very simple. It has no nucleus or cytoplasm, and is composed of a core of genetic material surrounded by a protein coat (Figure 2.13). The genetic material can be either DNA, or a similar chemical called ribonucleic acid (RNA). In either case, the genetic material makes up just a few genes – all that is needed for the virus to reproduce inside its host cell.

ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES    THE VARIETY OF LIVING ORGANISMS    27

Figure 2.13 The structure of a typical virus, such as the type causing influenza (flu).

Sometimes a membrane called an envelope may surround a virus particle, but the virus does not make this. Instead it is 'stolen' from the surface membrane of the host cell.

Viruses do not feed, respire, excrete, move, grow or respond to their surroundings. They do not carry out any of the normal 'characteristics' of living things except reproduction, and they can only do this parasitically. This is why biologists do not consider viruses to be living organisms. You can think of them as being on the border between an organism and a non-living chemical.

A virus reproduces by entering the host cell and taking over the host's genetic machinery to make more virus particles. After many virus particles have been made, the host cell dies and the particles are released to infect more cells. Many human diseases are caused in this way, such as influenza ('flu'). Other examples include colds, measles, mumps, polio and rubella ('German measles'). Of course, the reproduction process does not continue forever. Usually, the body's immune system destroys the virus and the person recovers. Sometimes, however, a virus cannot be destroyed by the immune system quickly enough, and it may cause permanent damage or death. With other infections, the virus may attack cells of the immune system itself. This is the case with HIV (the Human Immunodeficiency Virus), which causes the illness called AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome).

Viruses don't just parasitise animal cells. Some infect plant cells, such as the tobacco mosaic virus (Figure 2.14), which interferes with the ability of the tobacco plant to make chloroplasts, causing mottled patches to develop on the leaves (Figure 2.15).

## EXTENSION WORK

AIDS is not actually a disease but a 'syndrome'. A syndrome is a set of symptoms caused by a medical condition. In the case of HIV, the virus severely damages the person's immune system, so they are more likely to get other diseases, such as tuberculosis. They may also develop some unusual types of cancer. This collection of different symptoms is referred to as AIDS.
