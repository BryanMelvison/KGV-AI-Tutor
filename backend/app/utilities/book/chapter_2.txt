# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES

## THE VARIETY OF LIVING ORGANISMS

### ANIMALS
THE ANIMAL KINGDOM IS DIVERSE, ENCOMPASSING A WIDE RANGE OF SPECIES, INCLUDING HUMANS (HOMO SAPIENS). THIS KINGDOM INCLUDES ORGANISMS SUCH AS SPONGES, MOLLUSCS, WORMS, STARFISH, INSECTS, CRUSTACEANS, FISH, AMPHIBIANS, REPTILES, BIRDS, AND MAMMALS. AMONG THESE, THE LATTER FIVE GROUPS—FISH, AMPHIBIANS, REPTILES, BIRDS, AND MAMMALS—ARE VERTEBRATES, POSSESSING A BACKBONE. THE REMAINING GROUPS ARE INVERTEBRATES, LACKING THIS FEATURE.

### VERTEBRATES AND INVERTEBRATES
VERTEBRATES AND INVERTEBRATES DIFFER FUNDAMENTALLY. VERTEBRATES HAVE A BACKBONE AND INCLUDE FISH, AMPHIBIANS, REPTILES, BIRDS, AND MAMMALS. INVERTEBRATES LACK A BACKBONE AND INCLUDE INSECTS, SPIDERS, CRUSTACEANS, MOLLUSCS, AND WORMS. BOTH GROUPS ARE MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS THAT DERIVE THEIR NUTRITION BY CONSUMING OTHER ORGANISMS.

### CHARACTERISTICS OF ANIMALS
ANIMALS ARE MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS WITHOUT CHLOROPLASTS, UNABLE TO PERFORM PHOTOSYNTHESIS. THEY OBTAIN NUTRIENTS BY FEEDING ON OTHER ORGANISMS. THEIR CELLS LACK WALLS, ALLOWING FLEXIBILITY FOR MOVEMENT, COORDINATED BY A NERVOUS SYSTEM. MOST STORE CARBOHYDRATES AS GLYCOGEN, WHICH IS EXPLORED IN MORE DETAIL IN UNIT 2.

### FUNGI
FUNGI INCLUDE BOTH MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS LIKE MUSHROOMS AND UNICELLULAR YEASTS. YEASTS ARE FOUND IN VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING FRUITS, SOIL, WATER, AND AIR. FUNGAL CELL WALLS CONSIST OF CHITIN, UNLIKE PLANTS' CELLULOSE. THEY CANNOT PHOTOSYNTHESIZE DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF CHLOROPLASTS.

### SUMMARY
- **ANIMALS**: MULTICELLULAR, LACK CHLOROPLASTS, DERIVE NUTRITION BY FEEDING, HAVE NERVOUS SYSTEMS FOR MOVEMENT, AND STORE CARBOHYDRATES AS GLYCOGEN.
- **FUNGI**: INCLUDE BOTH MULTICELLULAR AND UNICELLULAR ORGANISMS WITH CHITIN CELL WALLS AND NO PHOTOSYNTHETIC ABILITY.

THIS OVERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS THE DIVERSITY AND UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF ANIMALS AND FUNGI, PROVIDING A FOUNDATION FOR EXPLORING LIFE PROCESSES IN THESE ORGANISMS.

# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES

## THE VARIETY OF LIVING ORGANISMS

### KEY POINT
THE SINGULAR OF HYPHAE IS **HYPHA**.

---

## FUNGI: MUSHROOMS AND MOULDS

MUSHROOMS OR TOADSTOOLS ARE THE FRUITING BODIES OF FUNGI, REFERRED TO AS **FRUITING BODIES**. BENEATH THE SOIL, A MUSHROOM CONSISTS OF MANY FINE, THREAD-LIKE FILAMENTS CALLED **HYPHAE** (PRONOUNCED HIGH-FEE). THESE HYPHAE FORM A NETWORK KNOWN AS **MYCELIUM**, WHICH IS THE VEGETATIVE PART OF THE FUNGUS.

MOULDS, SUCH AS THE 'PIN MOULD' MUCOR, LACK FRUITING BODIES AND CONSIST SOLELY OF HYPHAE. THEY FEED BY ABSORBING NUTRIENTS FROM DEAD OR LIVING MATERIAL THROUGH SAPROTROPHIC NUTRITION. THIS PROCESS INVOLVES THE SECRETION OF EXTRACELLULAR ENZYMES THAT BREAK DOWN ORGANIC MATTER INTO SOLUBLE SUBSTANCES LIKE SUGARS, WHICH ARE THEN ABSORBED.

WHEN EXPOSED TO AIR, BREAD OR FRUIT CAN QUICKLY BECOME MOULDY AS MOULD SPORES LAND AND GROW INTO A MYCELIUM OF HYPHAE. THE HYPHAE OF MUCOR HAVE CELL WALLS ENCLOSING THEIR CYTOPLASM, CONTAINING MANY NUCLEI. THEY BRANCH REPEATEDLY UNTIL THEY COVER THE FOOD SOURCE, DEPLETING IT AND PROMPTING FURTHER INFECTION BY PRODUCING MORE SPORES.

---

## STRUCTURE OF MOULDS

THE HYPHAE OF MUCOR ARE UNIQUE AS THEY LACK SEPARATION INTO INDIVIDUAL CELLS. INSTEAD, EACH HYPHA SHARES ITS CYTOPLASM WITH MULTIPLE NUCLEI. THIS STRUCTURE ALLOWS THEM TO GROW AND BRANCH EXTENSIVELY, FORMING A NETWORK THAT EFFICIENTLY COVERS AND BREAKS DOWN THEIR FOOD SOURCE.

---

## SAPROTROPHIC NUTRITION

SAPROTROPHIC NUTRITION REFERS TO THE PROCESS WHERE ORGANISMS FEED ON DEAD ORGANIC MATERIAL BY SECRETING EXTRACELLULAR ENZYMES. THESE ENZYMES BREAK DOWN THE FOOD EXTERNALLY, ENABLING MOULDS LIKE MUCOR TO ABSORB NUTRIENTS AND GROW. THIS FEEDING STRATEGY IS COMMON IN FUNGI, ALLOWING THEM TO THRIVE IN ENVIRONMENTS RICH IN DECAYING MATTER.

THIS REFORMATTING ADHERES TO THE GIVEN RULES, ENSURING CLARITY, STRUCTURE, AND FACTUAL CONTENT WHILE AVOIDING UNNECESSARY ELEMENTS.

# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES

## THE VARIETY OF LIVING ORGANISMS

### PROTOCTISTS
PROTOCTISTS ARE A DIVERSE GROUP OF ORGANISMS THAT DO NOT FIT INTO THE TRADITIONAL CATEGORIES OF PLANTS, ANIMALS, OR FUNGI. MOST PROTOCTISTS ARE MICROSCOPIC, SINGLE-CELLED ORGANISMS.

- **PROTOZOA**: SOME PROTOCTISTS, SUCH AS AMOEBA, RESEMBLE ANIMAL CELLS AND CAN BE FOUND IN POND WATER. THESE ORGANISMS MOVE USING PSEUDOPODIA, WHICH ARE TEMPORARY PROJECTIONS OF THEIR CELL MEMBRANE.
  
- **ALGAE**: OTHER PROTOCTISTS, LIKE CHLORELLA, CONTAIN CHLOROPLASTS AND PERFORM PHOTOSYNTHESIS, MAKING THEM MORE PLANT-LIKE. MOST ALGAE REMAIN UNICELLULAR, BUT SOME, SUCH AS SEAWEEDS, GROW INTO MULTICELLULAR FORMS AND CAN REACH SIGNIFICANT SIZES.

**DISEASES**: PROTOCTISTS CAN ALSO CAUSE DISEASES. FOR EXAMPLE, PLASMODIUM, A PROTOZOAN PARASITE, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MALARIA.

### EUKARYOTIC AND PROKARYOTIC ORGANISMS
ALL ORGANISMS DISCUSSED SO FAR ARE COMPOSED OF EUKARYOTIC CELLS, WHICH ARE CHARACTERIZED BY HAVING A NUCLEUS SURROUNDED BY A MEMBRANE. THESE STRUCTURES INCLUDE ORGANELLES LIKE MITOCHONDRIA AND CHLOROPLASTS, CONTRIBUTING TO THEIR COMPLEX CELLULAR ORGANIZATION.

IN CONTRAST, PROKARYOTIC ORGANISMS LACK A NUCLEUS AND OTHER ORGANELLES. THE PRIMARY FORM OF PROKARYOTIC ORGANISMS IS BACTERIA, WHICH HAVE SIMPLER CELLS.

### BACTERIA
BACTERIA ARE SMALL, SINGLE-CELLED ORGANISMS WITH A MUCH SMALLER SIZE THAN EUKARYOTIC CELLS. THEIR CELLS TYPICALLY MEASURE 0.5 TO 5 MICROMETERS IN LENGTH, COMPARED TO THE LARGER SIZE OF ANIMAL CELLS (10 TO 50 ΜM).

**SHAPES**: BACTERIA EXHIBIT THREE PRIMARY SHAPES:
- **SPHERICAL (COCCI)**: ROUND AND OFTEN APPEAR AS PAIRS OR CHAINS.
- **ROD-SHAPED (BACILLI)**: LONG AND CYLINDRICAL WITH A ROUNDED OR POINTED END.
- **SPIRAL (SPIRILLA)**: FORMED IN A HELICAL SHAPE.

DESPITE THEIR VARIED SHAPES, ALL BACTERIA SHARE SIMILAR INTERNAL STRUCTURES.

**STRUCTURE**: BACTERIA ARE ENCLOSED BY A CELL WALL MADE OF PEPTIDOGLYCAN, WHICH PROVIDES STRUCTURAL SUPPORT AND PROTECTION. SOME SPECIES HAVE AN ADDITIONAL CAPSULE OR SLIME LAYER FOR FURTHER PROTECTION. THE CELL MEMBRANE IS LOCATED BENEATH THE CELL WALL, AND THE CYTOPLASM CONTAINS GENETIC MATERIAL IN THE FORM OF A CIRCULAR CHROMOSOME.

# THE VARIETY OF LIVING ORGANISMS

## BACTERIA: STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

BACTERIA ARE DIVERSE MICROORGANISMS THAT COME IN VARIOUS SHAPES AND SIZES. THESE SHAPES INCLUDE SPHERES (COCCI), RODS (BACILLI), AND SPIRALS (SPIRILLA). SOME BACTERIAL SHAPES CAN EXIST AS SINGLES, PAIRS, CHAINS, OR CLUSTERS.

### INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF A BACTERIUM

A TYPICAL BACTERIUM CONSISTS OF SEVERAL KEY COMPONENTS: THE CELL WALL, WHICH PROVIDES STRUCTURE AND PROTECTION; THE CELL SURFACE MEMBRANE, WHICH REGULATES WHAT ENTERS AND EXITS THE CELL; THE CHROMOSOME (NUCLEOID), CONTAINING THE BACTERIUM'S GENETIC MATERIAL; PLASMIDS, SMALL CIRCULAR RINGS OF DNA THAT CARRY ADDITIONAL GENES; AND FLAGELLA, WHIP-LIKE STRUCTURES USED FOR MOVEMENT.

### BACTERIAL MOVEMENT AND NUTRITION

SOME BACTERIA USE FLAGELLA TO SWIM THROUGH THEIR ENVIRONMENT. OTHERS LACK INDEPENDENT MOVEMENT. MOST BACTERIA FEED ON OTHER LIVING OR DEAD ORGANISMS, ACTING AS DECOMPOSERS IN ECOSYSTEMS WHERE THEY RECYCLE DEAD ORGANISMS AND WASTE PRODUCTS IN THE SOIL. FOR EXAMPLE, *LACTOBACILLUS BULGARICUS* IS USED IN FOOD PRODUCTION, SUCH AS YOGURT.

### PATHOGENS

PATHOGENS ARE ORGANISMS THAT CAUSE DISEASE. EXAMPLES INCLUDE MOLD, WHICH CAN CAUSE CONDITIONS LIKE ATHLETE'S FOOT, AND *PLASMODIUM*, A PROTOCTIST RESPONSIBLE FOR MALARIA. DESPITE THEIR SIMPLE STRUCTURE, BACTERIA PERFORM ESSENTIAL LIFE PROCESSES, INCLUDING RESPIRATION, FEEDING, EXCRETION, GROWTH, AND REPRODUCTION. THEY CAN RESPOND TO STIMULI BY MOVING TOWARD FOOD OR AWAY FROM HARMFUL SUBSTANCES.

## VIRUSES: STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

VIRUSES ARE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM BACTERIA. THEY ARE PARASITES THAT CAN ONLY REPRODUCE INSIDE LIVING CELLS (HOSTS). VIRUSES ARE MUCH SMALLER THAN BACTERIAL CELLS, TYPICALLY RANGING FROM 0.01 TO 0.1 MICROMETERS IN DIAMETER. A VIRUS PARTICLE CONSISTS OF A CORE OF GENETIC MATERIAL (EITHER DNA OR RNA) SURROUNDED BY A PROTEIN COAT; THEY LACK A NUCLEUS AND CYTOPLASM.

THE GENETIC MATERIAL OF A VIRUS CONTAINS JUST A FEW GENES, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE VIRUS TO REPRODUCE INSIDE ITS HOST CELL.

### COMPARISON

WHILE BACTERIA ARE LIVING ORGANISMS CAPABLE OF CARRYING OUT LIFE PROCESSES, VIRUSES ARE NON-LIVING ENTITIES THAT REQUIRE A HOST TO REPRODUCE. UNDERSTANDING THESE DIFFERENCES IS CRUCIAL IN THE STUDY OF MICROBIOLOGY AND THEIR IMPACT ON HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT.

# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES

## VIRUSES: A UNIQUE CATEGORY OF LIFE

VIRUSES EXIST ON THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN LIVING AND NON-LIVING ENTITIES. THEY RANGE IN SIZE FROM **0.01 TO 0.1 MICROMETERS**. A TYPICAL VIRUS, SUCH AS THE INFLUENZA VIRUS, CONSISTS OF:

- **GENETIC MATERIAL**: EITHER DNA OR RNA.
- **PROTEIN COAT**: PROTECTS THE GENETIC MATERIAL.
- **ENVELOPE**: SOMETIMES SURROUNDS THE VIRUS PARTICLE, SOURCED FROM THE HOST CELL'S MEMBRANE.

!FIGURE 2.13: STRUCTURE OF A TYPICAL VIRUS, SUCH AS THE TYPE CAUSING INFLUENZA (FLU).

VIRUSES LACK CHARACTERISTICS LIKE FEEDING, RESPIRATION, EXCRETION, MOVEMENT, GROWTH, AND RESPONSE TO SURROUNDINGS. THEIR ONLY LIFE FUNCTION IS REPRODUCTION, WHICH OCCURS PARASITICALLY BY INFECTING HOST CELLS AND USING THEIR MACHINERY TO PRODUCE MORE VIRUSES, EVENTUALLY LEADING TO HOST CELL DEATH.

## HUMAN DISEASES CAUSED BY VIRUSES

MANY HUMAN DISEASES ARE VIRAL, INCLUDING INFLUENZA (FLU), COLDS, MEASLES, MUMPS, POLIO, AND RUBELLA. TYPICALLY, THE IMMUNE SYSTEM ELIMINATES VIRUSES, ALLOWING RECOVERY. HOWEVER, HIV CAN DAMAGE THE IMMUNE SYSTEM, LEADING TO AIDS, A SYNDROME CHARACTERIZED BY VARIOUS SYMPTOMS DUE TO IMPAIRED IMMUNITY.

## PLANT VIRUSES

VIRUSES ALSO AFFECT PLANT CELLS. THE TOBACCO MOSAIC VIRUS (TMV) DISRUPTS CHLOROPLAST FUNCTION IN TOBACCO PLANTS, CAUSING MOTTLED LEAF PATCHES.

!FIGURE 2.14: TOBACCO MOSAIC VIRUS (TMV), SEEN THROUGH AN ELECTRON MICROSCOPE.
!FIGURE 2.15: LEAF DISCOLORATION CAUSED BY TMV INFECTION.

## EXTENSION WORK: UNDERSTANDING AIDS

AIDS IS A SYNDROME, NOT A DISEASE, RESULTING FROM HIV'S DESTRUCTION OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM, INCREASING SUSCEPTIBILITY TO OTHER DISEASES AND CANCERS.

## CHAPTER QUESTIONS

WHICH CHARACTERISTIC IS NOT TYPICAL OF PLANTS?

- **A) CELLS CONTAIN CHLOROPLASTS**: PLANTS HAVE CHLOROPLASTS FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS.
- **B) CELL WALL MADE OF CELLULOSE**: CORRECT IN PLANTS.
- **C) BODIES ARE MULTICELLULAR**: PLANTS ARE MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS.
- **D) STORE CARBOHYDRATE AS GLYCOGEN**: INCORRECT; PLANTS STORE CARBOHYDRATES AS STARCH, NOT GLYCOGEN.

MORE QUESTIONS ON VARIOUS ORGANISMS ARE AVAILABLE IN UNIT 1 ON PAGE 29.

## SKILLS AND CRITICAL THINKING

REFLECTING ON VIRAL INFECTIONS HIGHLIGHTS THEIR IMPACT ON HEALTH AND AGRICULTURE. VIRUSES CHALLENGE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE AND DISEASE DYNAMICS.

# THE VARIETY OF LIVING ORGANISMS

## INTRODUCTION TO ORGANISMS

LIVING ORGANISMS CAN BE CLASSIFIED INTO VARIOUS GROUPS BASED ON THEIR CHARACTERISTICS AND LIFE PROCESSES.

### KEY CONCEPTS

- **SAPROTROPHIC NUTRITION**: REFERS TO THE EXTRACELLULAR DIGESTION OF DEAD ORGANIC MATTER BY FUNGI TO OBTAIN NUTRIENTS.

### CLASSIFICATION OF ORGANISMS

BELOW ARE THREE GROUPS OF ORGANISMS:

1. VIRUSES
2. BACTERIA
3. YEASTS

AMONG THESE GROUPS, ONLY BACTERIA ARE PROKARYOTIC. PROKARYOTIC ORGANISMS LACK A NUCLEUS AND MEMBRANE-BOUND ORGANELLES.

### DISEASES AND THEIR CAUSES

WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING DISEASES IS NOT CAUSED BY A VIRUS?

- INFLUENZA (VIRUS)
- MEASLES (VIRUS)
- MALARIA (PARASITE)
- AIDS (VIRUS)

### KINGDOM CLASSIFICATION

NAME THE KINGDOM TO WHICH EACH OF THE FOLLOWING ORGANISMS BELONGS:

- MUSHROOM: FUNGI
- CHLORELLA: PLANTAE OR PROTISTA (DEPENDING ON CLASSIFICATION)
- MOSS: PLANTAE
- LACTOBACILLUS: BACTERIA

## UNDERSTANDING PROTOCTISTS

### EUGLENA

THE DIAGRAM ILLUSTRATES A PROTOCTIST CALLED EUGLENA. IT IS CLASSIFIED AS NEITHER AN ANIMAL NOR A PLANT, COMBINING CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH. EUGLENA USES A FLAGELLUM FOR MOVEMENT AND PERFORMS PHOTOSYNTHESIS VIA CHLOROPLASTS.

### VIRUS STRUCTURE

A TYPICAL VIRUS PARTICLE CONSISTS OF A PROTEIN COAT ENCLOSING A GENOME.

### LIVING OR NOT?

CRITICAL THINKING: IS A VIRUS A LIVING ORGANISM? VIRUSES ARE PARASITES WITHOUT CELLS OR INDEPENDENT METABOLIC PROCESSES, THUS THEY ARE NOT CONSIDERED LIVING ORGANISMS.

### TERMINOLOGY

- **INVERTEBRATE**: AN ANIMAL LACKING A BACKBONE.
- **HYPHAE**: THREAD-LIKE STRUCTURES FORMING THE BODY OF FUNGI.
- **SAPROTROPHIC**: ORGANISMS THAT DECOMPOSE DEAD ORGANIC MATTER FOR NUTRIENTS.

## CONCLUSION

UNDERSTANDING ORGANISM CLASSIFICATIONS IS CRUCIAL IN BIOLOGY, HIGHLIGHTING THE COMPLEXITY AND DIVERSITY OF LIFE ON EARTH.

# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES

## UNIT QUESTIONS

### SKILLS: CRITICAL THINKING
1. **IDENTIFY ORGANELLES**  
THE FOLLOWING ORGANELLES ARE FOUND IN CELLS: NUCLEUS, CHLOROPLAST, AND MITOCHONDRION.  
- WHICH OF THE ABOVE ORGANELLES WOULD BE FOUND IN:  
  - A CELL FROM A HUMAN MUSCLE?  
  - A PALISADE CELL FROM A LEAF?  
  - A CELL FROM THE ROOT OF A PLANT?

2. **EXPLAIN DIFFERENCES**  
THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PALISADE CELL AND THE ROOT CELL DIFFER BECAUSE THE PRESENCE OR FUNCTION OF ORGANELLES DEPENDS ON THE SPECIFIC TYPE OF CELL AND ITS ROLE IN THE ORGANISM.

3. **FUNCTION OF ORGANELLES**  
- NUCLEUS: CONTROLS CELL DIVISION, GENETIC INFORMATION STORAGE, AND PROTEIN SYNTHESIS.  
- CHLOROPLAST: PRODUCES ENERGY (ATP) THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND SYNTHESIZES ORGANIC MOLECULES.  
- MITOCHONDRION: PRODUCES ATP FOR THE CELL AND IS INVOLVED IN CELLULAR RESPIRATION.

### SKILLS: UNDERSTANDING ORGAN SYSTEMS
4. **ORGAN STRUCTURE**  
IN MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS, CELLS ARE ORGANIZED INTO TISSUES, ORGANS, AND ORGAN SYSTEMS.  

- AN ARTERY CAN BE CONSIDERED AN ORGAN BECAUSE IT HAS A SPECIFIC STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION (TRANSPORTING OXYGENATED BLOOD) UNIQUE TO ITS ROLE IN THE BODY. A CAPILLARY, HOWEVER, IS TOO SIMPLE IN STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION TO BE CLASSIFIED AS AN ORGAN.

5. **DIGESTIVE SYSTEM**  
THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BREAKING DOWN FOOD INTO NUTRIENTS THAT CAN BE ABSORBED BY THE BODY.  

- THE HUMAN DIGESTIVE SYSTEM INCLUDES ORGANS SUCH AS THE MOUTH (ORAL CAVITY), ESOPHAGUS, STOMACH, INTESTINES, AND LIVER. EACH ORGAN PLAYS A SPECIFIC ROLE IN DIGESTION:  
  - MOUTH: CHEWING AND MIXING FOOD WITH SALIVA TO BEGIN DIGESTION.  
  - ESOPHAGUS: MOVES FOOD THROUGH THE THROAT INTO THE STOMACH.  
  - STOMACH: BREAKS DOWN FOOD USING GASTRIC JUICES AND EXTRACTS NUTRIENTS.  
  - INTESTINES: ABSORBS NUTRIENTS INTO THE BLOODSTREAM.  
  - LIVER: PRODUCES BILE, WHICH AIDS IN DIGESTION AND STORES VITAMINS.  

- OTHER HUMAN ORGAN SYSTEMS INCLUDE THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM (E.G., HEART, BLOOD VESSELS) AND THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM (E.G., LUNGS, TRACHEA).

# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES

## UNIT QUESTIONS

### SKILLS: ANALYSIS

1. **CATALASE INVESTIGATION**
   CATALASE IS AN ENZYME FOUND IN MANY PLANT AND ANIMAL CELLS THAT CATALYZES THE BREAKDOWN OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDE INTO WATER AND OXYGEN:
   \[
   \TEXT{HYDROGEN PEROXIDE} \XRIGHTARROW{\TEXT{CATALASE}} \TEXT{WATER} + \TEXT{OXYGEN}
   \]
   
   IN AN INVESTIGATION, 20 G OF POTATO TISSUE CONTAINING HYDROGEN PEROXIDE WEIGHING 80 G WAS PLACED INTO A BEAKER MAINTAINED AT 20°C. THE MASS OF THE BEAKER AND ITS CONTENTS WERE RECORDED UNTIL NO FURTHER CHANGE OCCURRED. RESULTS ARE SHOWN IN THE GRAPH BELOW:
   
   !GRAPH SHOWING THE CHANGE IN MASS OVER TIME
   
   - HOW MUCH OXYGEN WAS FORMED IN THIS INVESTIGATION?
   EXPLAIN YOUR ANSWER: (2 MARKS)
   
   - ESTIMATE THE TIME BY WHICH HALF THIS MASS OF OXYGEN HAD BEEN FORMED.
   (2 MARKS)

2. **RATE OF REACTION**
   THE RATE OF REACTION CHANGES DURING THE INVESTIGATION BECAUSE COLLISIONS BETWEEN ENZYME AND SUBSTRATE MOLECULES INCREASE OR DECREASE OVER TIME, AFFECTING THE REACTION'S PROGRESS.

3. **TEMPERATURE VARIATION**
   REPEATING THE INVESTIGATION AT 30°C WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN:
   
   - A HIGHER MASS OF OXYGEN FORMED DUE TO INCREASED ENZYME ACTIVITY.
   - FASTER FORMATION OF THE SAME MASS OF OXYGEN AS ENZYMES WORK MORE EFFICIENTLY AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES.

### SKILLS: REASONING

4. **MOVEMENT ACROSS CELL MEMBRANES**
   ACTIVE TRANSPORT, OSMOSIS, AND DIFFUSION SHARE SIMILARITIES IN MOVING PARTICLES DOWN CONCENTRATION GRADIENTS BUT DIFFER IN ENERGY REQUIREMENTS AND MECHANISMS:

   | FEATURE                                   | ACTIVE TRANSPORT | OSMOSIS | DIFFUSION |
   |-------------------------------------------|------------------|---------|-----------|
   | PARTICLES MUST HAVE KINETIC ENERGY        | ✓               |         |           |
   | REQUIRES ENERGY FROM RESPIRATION           | ✓               |         |           |
   | PARTICLES MOVE DOWN A CONCENTRATION GRADIENT |                  |         |           |

   - ACTIVE TRANSPORT REQUIRES ATP, WHILE OSMOSIS AND DIFFUSION DO NOT.
   - OSMOSIS INVOLVES THE MOVEMENT OF WATER ACROSS MEMBRANES BY DIFFUSION.
   - DIFFUSION OCCURS PASSIVELY WITHOUT ENERGY EXPENDITURE.

# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES

## UNIT QUESTIONS

### CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS

THE GRAPH ILLUSTRATES THE RATE OF SODIUM ION DIFFUSION ACROSS POTATO CELL MEMBRANES AT VARIOUS TEMPERATURES. THE DIFFUSION RATE INCREASES SIGNIFICANTLY UP TO 40°C, LIKELY DUE TO INCREASED MOLECULAR MOTION WITH TEMPERATURE. BEYOND THIS POINT, THE STEEP RISE IN RATE SUGGESTS A POSSIBLE SATURATION EFFECT OR MEMBRANE STABILIZATION, WHICH MAY LIMIT FURTHER INCREASES.

**QUESTION 1:** EXPLAIN THE OBSERVED INCREASE IN DIFFUSION RATE AS TEMPERATURE RISES FROM 0°C TO 40°C.  
**QUESTION 2:** SUGGEST REASONS FOR THE MORE GRADUAL INCREASE IN RATE AT TEMPERATURES ABOVE 40°C.

### REASONING SKILLS

IN SMALL INTESTINE CELLS, MITOSIS REPLACES LOST CELLS AS FOOD PASSES THROUGH. DNA DUPLICATION BEFORE MITOSIS ENSURES EACH NEW CELL HAS SUFFICIENT GENETIC MATERIAL FOR PROPER FUNCTION AND GROWTH.

**QUESTION 1:** WHY IS DOUBLING DNA CONTENT ESSENTIAL BEFORE MITOSIS?  
**QUESTION 2:** WHAT HAPPENS AT POINT Y IN THE DNA CONTENT GRAPH?

### ANALYSIS SKILLS

THE DIAGRAM DEPICTS A SMALL INTESTINE VILLUS CELL INVOLVED IN GLUCOSE ABSORPTION. VILLI ENHANCE NUTRIENT ABSORPTION BY INCREASING SURFACE AREA THROUGH MICROVILLI, ALLOWING EFFICIENT EXCHANGE OF MOLECULES.

**QUESTION 1:** HOW DO VILLI CONTRIBUTE TO NUTRIENT ABSORPTION?  
**QUESTION 2:** HOW DO MICROVILLI ADAPT THE CELL FOR GLUCOSE ABSORPTION?  
**QUESTION 3:** EXPLAIN HOW ACTIVE TRANSPORT FACILITATES GLUCOSE ABSORPTION INTO THE BLOODSTREAM.

| 2          | 18            |
| 3          | 20            |

**ASSUMPTIONS:** MAGGOTS RESPIRE AEROBICALLY.

1. **AEROBIC RESPIRATION EQUATION:**
   \[ \TEXT{C}_6\TEXT{H}_{12}\TEXT{O}_6 + 6\TEXT{O}_2 \RIGHTARROW 6\TEXT{CO}_2 + 6\TEXT{H}_2\TEXT{O} \]

2. **OXYGEN AND CARBON DIOXIDE RELATIONSHIP:**
   THE AMOUNT OF OXYGEN TAKEN IN EQUALS THE CARBON DIOXIDE PRODUCED, AS PER THE EQUATION.

3. **EXPLANATION:** IN AEROBIC RESPIRATION, GLUCOSE USES OXYGEN TO PRODUCE CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER.

4. **RESULT VARIATION:** RESULT 2 DIFFERS; POSSIBLE REASONS INCLUDE MAGGOT ACTIVITY OR ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS.

5. **ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION IMPACT:** ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION WOULD LIKELY REDUCE BEAD MOVEMENT DUE TO LOWER ENERGY PRODUCTION AND LESS CARBON DIOXIDE.

# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES

## UNIT 1: COMPLETE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNT

PLANTS HAVE CELL WALLS COMPOSED OF **CELLULOSE**. THEY STORE CARBOHYDRATES AS INSOLUBLE STARCH OR SOMETIMES AS THE SUGAR **SUCROSE**, WHICH ARE PRODUCTS OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS. ANIMALS, IN CONTRAST, STORE CARBOHYDRATES AS **GLYCOGEN**. BOTH PLANTS AND ANIMALS HAVE NUCLEI IN THEIR CELLS, BUT BACTERIA LACK A TRUE NUCLEUS, INSTEAD HAVING THEIR DNA ARRANGED IN CIRCULAR CHROMOSOMES. BACTERIA MAY ALSO CONTAIN SMALL RINGS OF DNA CALLED **PLASMIDS**, WHICH ARE UTILIZED IN GENETIC ENGINEERING. BACTERIA AND FUNGI ACT AS DECOMPOSERS, BREAKING DOWN ORGANIC MATTER IN THE SOIL. SOME BACTERIA FUNCTION AS PATHOGENS, CAPABLE OF CAUSING DISEASE.

## UNIT 2: INVESTIGATING GERMINATION OF PEA SEEDS

THE EXPERIMENT INVESTIGATES THE GERMINATION OF PEA SEEDS USING AN APPARATUS THAT INCLUDES A VACUUM FLASK, GERMINATING PEAS, DEAD PEAS, COTTON WOOL, AND A THERMOMETER. THE SETUP INVOLVES TWO FLASKS LEFT FOR 24 HOURS AT AN INITIAL TEMPERATURE OF 19°C. AFTER THIS PERIOD, THE TEMPERATURE IN THE FLASK WITH GERMINATING PEAS RISES TO 22°C, WHILE THE FLASK WITH DEAD PEAS REMAINS AT 19°C.

**THE DIFFERENCE IN TEMPERATURE IS DUE TO METABOLIC ACTIVITY IN THE GERMINATING SEEDS, WHICH PRODUCE HEAT THROUGH CELLULAR RESPIRATION.**

BEFORE THE EXPERIMENT, THE SEEDS WERE WASHED IN DISINFECTANT TO ELIMINATE ANY MICROORGANISMS THAT COULD INTERFERE WITH THE RESULTS AND ENSURE STERILITY.

COTTON WOOL WAS USED INSTEAD OF A RUBBER BUNG BECAUSE IT PROVIDES BETTER AERATION FOR THE SEEDS, ALLOWING OXYGEN TO CIRCULATE WHILE PREVENTING CONTAMINATION FROM EXTERNAL FACTORS.

AN ADDITIONAL VARIABLE THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONTROLLED IS THE AMOUNT OF WATER PROVIDED TO THE SEEDS IN EACH FLASK TO MAINTAIN CONSISTENT CONDITIONS ACROSS BOTH TREATMENTS.

## UNIT 3: INVESTIGATING MUSCLE FIBRES

A PIECE OF MEAT CONSISTS OF MUSCLE FIBRES. THESE FIBRES UTILIZE **ATP** DURING CONTRACTION. AN INVESTIGATION COULD INVOLVE IMMERSING MUSCLE FIBRES IN A SOLUTION CONTAINING ATP AND OBSERVING WHETHER CONTRACTION OCCURS, FOLLOWED BY A RELAXATION PHASE UPON REMOVAL OF THE ATP SOLUTION. THIS SETUP AIMS TO STUDY THE ROLE OF ATP IN MUSCLE CONTRACTION.

# BIOLOGY UNIT 2: ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY

## INTRODUCTION TO PHYSIOLOGY  
PHYSIOLOGY IS THE STUDY OF HOW LIVING ORGANISMS FUNCTION AT VARIOUS LEVELS, FROM CELLS TO ENTIRE ORGANISMS. IT EXAMINES THE MECHANISMS AND PROCESSES THAT SUSTAIN LIFE, FOCUSING ON THE STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL ORGANIZATION OF LIVING SYSTEMS.

### IMPORTANCE OF STUDYING PHYSIOLOGY  
UNDERSTANDING PHYSIOLOGY IS ESSENTIAL FOR MULTIPLE REASONS: IT PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO HOW THE BODY OPERATES, WHICH IS CRUCIAL FOR DIAGNOSING AND TREATING ILLNESSES. THE NOBEL PRIZE IN PHYSIOLOGY OR MEDICINE HIGHLIGHTS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS FIELD.

## TOPICS COVERED IN THIS UNIT  
THIS UNIT EXPLORES VARIOUS ASPECTS OF ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY, FOCUSING ON HUMAN BODILY FUNCTIONS. KEY TOPICS INCLUDE:

1. **BREATHING AND GAS EXCHANGE**  
   THIS PROCESS INVOLVES THE INTAKE OF OXYGEN AND RELEASE OF CARBON DIOXIDE THROUGH THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM. IT IS A VITAL MECHANISM FOR MAINTAINING OXYGEN LEVELS IN THE BLOOD.

2. **FOOD AND DIGESTION**  
   THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM BREAKS DOWN FOOD INTO NUTRIENTS THAT CAN BE ABSORBED BY THE BODY, ENSURING PROPER NUTRITION AND ENERGY PRODUCTION.

3. **BLOOD AND CIRCULATION**  
   BLOOD TRANSPORTS OXYGEN, NUTRIENTS, HORMONES, AND WASTE PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT THE BODY, MAINTAINING HOMEOSTASIS AND SUPPORTING BODILY FUNCTIONS.

4. **COORDINATION**  
   THE NERVOUS SYSTEM FACILITATES COMMUNICATION BETWEEN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BODY, COORDINATING ACTIONS SUCH AS MOVEMENT AND RESPONSE TO STIMULI.

5. **CHEMICAL COORDINATION**  
   THIS INVOLVES THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM, WHERE HORMONES REGULATE PROCESSES LIKE GROWTH, METABOLISM, AND REPRODUCTION BY TRANSMITTING SIGNALS THROUGHOUT THE BODY.

6. **HOMEOSTASIS AND EXCRETION**  
   HOMEOSTATIC MECHANISMS MAINTAIN INTERNAL BALANCE, WHILE EXCRETORY SYSTEMS ELIMINATE WASTE PRODUCTS, ENSURING THE BODY'S STABILITY AND HEALTH.

7. **REPRODUCTION IN HUMANS**  
   REPRODUCTIVE PROCESSES ENSURE THE CONTINUATION OF LIFE, INVOLVING COMPLEX HORMONAL INTERACTIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW INDIVIDUALS.
