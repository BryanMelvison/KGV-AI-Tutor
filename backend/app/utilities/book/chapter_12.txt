# CHAPTER 12: CHEMICAL COORDINATION IN PLANTS

PLANTS POSSESS THE ABILITY TO DETECT CHANGES IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT AND RESPOND TO STIMULI, THOUGH THEIR REACTIONS ARE TYPICALLY SLOWER THAN THOSE OF ANIMALS. THIS SLOWER RESPONSE IS DUE TO PLANTS RELYING ON GROWTH ADJUSTMENTS RATHER THAN RAPID MUSCULAR MOVEMENTS. THIS CHAPTER EXPLORES PLANT GROWTH RESPONSES AND THE CHEMICALS THAT MEDIATE THESE RESPONSES.

## PLANT RESPONSES TO STIMULI

WHILE MANY PLANTS REACT TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES MORE SLOWLY THAN ANIMALS, SOME SPECIES EXHIBIT RAPID RESPONSES. FOR INSTANCE, THE VENUS FLYTRAP HAS SPECIALIZED LEAVES CAPABLE OF CLOSING QUICKLY WHEN AN INSECT LANDS ON THEM. THIS SWIFT MOVEMENT IS FACILITATED BY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN TURGOR PRESSURE WITHIN SPECIFIC CELLS AT THE BASE OF THE LEAVES.

!FIGURE 12.1: THE VENUS FLYTRAP CATCHES AND DIGESTS INSECTS TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL NUTRIENTS. UPON DETECTING A FLY, THE PLANT RAPIDLY CLOSES ITS TRAPS DUE TO RAPID CELLULAR ADJUSTMENTS.

### TROPISMS

MOST PLANTS DO NOT REACT AS SWIFTLY AS THE VENUS FLYTRAP. INSTEAD, THEIR RESPONSES INVOLVE CHANGES IN GROWTH RATES. WHEN EXPOSED TO A STIMULUS, PLANTS MAY EXHIBIT DIFFERENTIAL GROWTH, LEADING TO BENDING OR DIRECTIONAL GROWTH IN STEMS AND ROOTS.

#### EXAMPLE OF TROPISM

CONSIDER A PLANT GROWING UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS WITH LIGHT PRIMARILY COMING FROM ABOVE. IF THE POT IS TILTED, THE PLANT WILL BEGIN TO BEND ITS SHOOT UPWARD. THIS BENDING RESULTS FROM DIFFERING GROWTH RATES ON EITHER SIDE OF THE STEM, AS THE PLANT RESPONDS TO THE ALTERED ORIENTATION.

!FIGURE 12.2: A BEAN PLANT HAS STARTED TO BEND ITS GROWING SHOOT UPWARDS AFTER BEING PLACED HORIZONTALLY, ILLUSTRATING A TROPISTIC RESPONSE.

### ROLE OF GROWTH HORMONES

THE MECHANISMS BEHIND THESE RESPONSES INVOLVE GROWTH HORMONES SUCH AS AUXINS, WHICH REGULATE DIFFERENTIAL CELL ELONGATION. UNDERSTANDING HOW PLANTS ADAPT THROUGH THESE CHEMICAL SIGNALS IS ESSENTIAL FOR GRASPING THEIR ABILITY TO THRIVE IN VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTS.

# PLANT PHYSIOLOGY: CHEMICAL COORDINATION IN PLANTS

## INTRODUCTION TO TROPISMS

PLANTS EXHIBIT RESPONSES TO ENVIRONMENTAL STIMULI SUCH AS LIGHT AND GRAVITY, KNOWN AS **TROPISMS**. THESE RESPONSES INFLUENCE GROWTH DIRECTION.

- **POSITIVE TROPISM**: GROWTH TOWARDS THE STIMULUS.
- **NEGATIVE TROPISM**: GROWTH AWAY FROM THE STIMULUS.

### KEY STIMULI

1. **LIGHT**: PLANTS RESPOND BY GROWING TOWARDS OR AWAY FROM IT.
2. **GRAVITY**: PLANTS GROW AGAINST OR TOWARDS IT, DEPENDING ON CONTEXT.

IN FIGURE 12.2, A PLANT'S STEM SHOWS POSITIVE PHOTOTROPISM (GROWING TOWARD LIGHT) AND NEGATIVE GEOTROPISM (GROWING AGAINST GRAVITY), ENABLING UPWARD GROWTH.

## IMPORTANCE OF LIGHT FOR PLANTS

THE SHOOT SYSTEM REQUIRES LIGHT FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS. MOST PLANTS EXHIBIT STRONG POSITIVE PHOTOTROPISM TO MAXIMIZE SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE, OBSERVED IN PLANTS NEAR WINDOWS (FIGURE 12.3).

### KEY POINT

- **PHOTOTROPISMS**: GROWTH RESPONSES DIRECTED BY LIGHT.
- **GEOTROPISMS**: GROWTH INFLUENCED BY GRAVITY.

LIGHT DISTRIBUTION AFFECTS GROWTH: UNIFORM LIGHT INDUCES NEGATIVE GEOTROPISM IN SHOOTS, WHILE ROOTS TYPICALLY EXHIBIT POSITIVE GEOTROPISM, GROWING DOWNWARD TO ACCESS WATER AND MINERALS, ENHANCING ANCHORAGE.

## SUMMARY OF TROPISMS

PLANTS RESPOND DIFFERENTLY TO STIMULI:

- **LIGHT**: SHOOTS GROW TOWARDS IT (POSITIVE PHOTOTROPISM), WHILE SOME MAY MOVE AWAY (NEGATIVE PHOTOTROPISM). ROOTS GENERALLY SHOW NO RESPONSE.
- **GRAVITY**: SHOOTS GROW AGAINST IT (NEGATIVE GEOTROPISM), WHILE ROOTS GROW TOWARD IT (POSITIVE GEOTROPISM).

## DETECTING THE LIGHT STIMULUS

PLANTS LACK SENSORY ORGANS BUT CAN DETECT STIMULI LIKE LIGHT AND GRAVITY. CHARLES DARWIN STUDIED PHOTOTROPISM USING CEREAL COLEOPTILES (FIGURE 12.4), PROTECTING EMERGING LEAVES.

### EXTENSION WORK

CHARLES DARWIN'S RESEARCH EXTENDED BEYOND EVOLUTION, INCLUDING PLANT HORMONES. INVESTIGATE HIS ACHIEVEMENTS FOR A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING.

## CONCLUSION

UNDERSTANDING PLANT RESPONSES TO ENVIRONMENTAL STIMULI THROUGH TROPISMS IS CRUCIAL FOR GRASPING GROWTH MECHANISMS. RESEARCH ON PLANT HORMONES REMAINS VITAL IN PLANT PHYSIOLOGY.

# PLANT PHYSIOLOGY: CHEMICAL COORDINATION IN PLANTS

## PHOTOTROPISM AND DARWIN'S EXPERIMENTS

IN 1880, CHARLES DARWIN CONDUCTED GROUNDBREAKING EXPERIMENTS TO INVESTIGATE HOW PLANTS RESPOND TO LIGHT, SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON PHOTOTROPISM. HIS WORK REVEALED THAT THE TIP OF THE COLEOPTILE DETECTS UNIDIRECTIONAL LIGHT AND TRANSMITS A SIGNAL TO A GROWTH ZONE BEHIND THE TIP, CAUSING THE PLANT TO BEND TOWARD THE LIGHT SOURCE.

### OBSERVATIONS FROM DARWIN'S EXPERIMENTS

WHEN THE COLEOPTILE IS INTACT, IT EXHIBITS GROWTH AND CURVATURE TOWARD THE LIGHT. IF THE TIP IS REMOVED, NO GROWTH OR BENDING OCCURS. COVERING THE TIP WITH AN OPAQUE CAP RESULTS IN GROWTH WITHOUT BENDING, INDICATING THAT LIGHT DETECTION IS ESSENTIAL FOR DIRECTIONAL GROWTH.

## THE SEARCH FOR CHEMICAL MESSENGERS

SINCE PLANTS LACK A NERVOUS SYSTEM, RESEARCHERS EXPLORED THE ROLE OF CHEMICAL MESSENGERS—PLANT HORMONES—IN MEDIATING PHOTOTROPISM. BETWEEN 1910 AND 1926, SEVERAL EXPERIMENTS WERE CONDUCTED TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THIS PHENOMENON.

### KEY EXPERIMENTS

**EXPERIMENT 1**: REMOVING THE TIP OF THE COLEOPTILE PLACED ON A MICA SHEET SHOWED NO BENDING. REPLACING THE TIP ON A GELATINE BLOCK ALLOWED NORMAL BENDING TOWARD THE LIGHT, SUGGESTING A CHEMICAL SIGNAL IS TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE GELATINE.

**EXPERIMENT 2**: REMOVING THE TIP AND PLACING IT UNILATERALLY ON ONE SIDE OF THE COLEOPTILE CAUSED BENDING WITHOUT UNILATERAL LIGHT, INDICATING THE HORMONE IS DISTRIBUTED UNEVENLY, PROMOTING GROWTH ON ONE SIDE.

THESE EXPERIMENTS LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW PLANTS USE CHEMICAL SIGNALS TO COORDINATE GROWTH AND RESPOND TO ENVIRONMENTAL STIMULI.

### SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

THROUGH THESE STUDIES, SCIENTISTS IDENTIFIED VARIOUS PLANT HORMONES INVOLVED IN GROWTH REGULATION AND LIGHT RESPONSE, SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCING OUR KNOWLEDGE OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY.

THE WORK OF DARWIN AND SUBSEQUENT RESEARCHERS HAS PROVIDED INSIGHTS INTO HOW PLANTS CHEMICALLY COORDINATE THEIR RESPONSES TO LIGHT, ILLUSTRATING THE COMPLEXITY OF PHOTOTROPISM AND ITS ROLE IN PLANT ADAPTATION.

# PLANT PHYSIOLOGY: CHEMICAL COORDINATION IN PLANTS

## EXPERIMENT 3: UNDERSTANDING PHOTOTROPISM

### OVERVIEW OF EXPERIMENTS

PHOTOTROPISM REFERS TO THE DIRECTIONAL GROWTH RESPONSE OF PLANTS TO LIGHT, CAUSING THEM TO BEND TOWARDS THE LIGHT SOURCE. SEVERAL EXPERIMENTS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO UNDERSTANDING THIS PHENOMENON.

IN THE FIRST EXPERIMENT, RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT THE GROWTH STIMULUS COULD PASS THROUGH GELATINE BUT NOT MICA, SUGGESTING THE PRESENCE OF A WATER-SOLUBLE CHEMICAL AS THE STIMULUS.

THE SECOND EXPERIMENT DEMONSTRATED THAT PHOTOTROPIC RESPONSES CAN OCCUR WITHOUT UNIDIRECTIONAL LIGHT BY DECAPITATING A COLEOPTILE AND OBSERVING BENDING WHEN THE TIP WAS PLACED ON ONE SIDE OF THE DECAPITATED STALK.

IN THE THIRD EXPERIMENT, THE COLEOPTILE TIP WAS REMOVED AND PLACED ON AGAR. THE HORMONE DIFFUSED FROM THE TIP, CAUSING THE SHOOT TO BEND TOWARDS THE LIGHT WHEN PLACED ON ONE SIDE, INDICATING THE HORMONE'S ROLE IN GROWTH STIMULATION AWAY FROM LIGHT.

### MECHANISM OF ACTION

THE HORMONE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS BENDING IS AUXIN, PRODUCED IN THE SHOOT TIP AND DIFFUSING DOWNWARD. WHEN EXPOSED TO UNIDIRECTIONAL LIGHT, AUXIN MOVES AWAY FROM THE LIGHT, CONCENTRATING ON THE DARK SIDE. THIS HIGHER CONCENTRATION STIMULATES CELL ELONGATION, CAUSING THE SHOOT TO BEND TOWARDS THE LIGHT.

### IDENTIFICATION OF AUXIN

SINCE THESE EXPERIMENTS, SCIENTISTS IDENTIFIED AUXIN AS THE HORMONE RESPONSIBLE FOR PHOTOTROPISM. IT IS CRUCIAL TO REFER TO IT IN THE PLURAL FORM 'AUXINS,' AS SEVERAL RELATED CHEMICALS MAKE UP THIS GROUP OF PLANT HORMONES.

### OTHER PLANT HORMONES

IN ADDITION TO AUXINS, FOUR MAIN GROUPS OF PLANT HORMONES REGULATE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT:

- **GIBBERELLINS:** PROMOTE CELL ELONGATION AND SEED GERMINATION.
- **CYTOKININS:** REGULATE BUD FORMATION AND LEAF DEVELOPMENT.
- **ABSCISIC ACID:** CONTROLS FRUIT RIPENING AND STOMATAL CLOSURE.
- **ETHENE:** INFLUENCES FRUIT RIPENING AND RESPONSES TO ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS.

### EXTENSION WORK: USING A CLINOSTAT TO SHOW TROPISMS

A CLINOSTAT IS AN APPARATUS WITH A ROTATING CORK DISC WHERE SEEDS ARE ATTACHED. IT ELIMINATES DIRECTIONAL STIMULI, ALLOWING CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTS ON PLANT RESPONSES TO GRAVITY AND LIGHT. THIS SETUP AIDS IN STUDYING PLANT TROPISMS UNDER VARIOUS CONDITIONS.

# PLANT PHYSIOLOGY: CHEMICAL COORDINATION IN PLANTS

## INTRODUCTION TO TROPISMS

TROPISMS REFER TO THE DIRECTIONAL GROWTH RESPONSES OF PLANTS TO ENVIRONMENTAL STIMULI. THEY CAN BE CATEGORIZED INTO TWO PRIMARY TYPES: PHOTOTROPISM, WHICH INVOLVES RESPONSES TO LIGHT, AND GEOTROPISM, WHICH INVOLVES RESPONSES TO GRAVITY.

### EXPERIMENT: DEMONSTRATING GEOTROPISM WITH A CLINOSTAT

**MATERIALS NEEDED:**  
- CLINOSTAT  
- COTTON WOOL  
- BEAN SEEDS (E.G., KIDNEY BEANS)  
- CORK DISCS  
- WATER  

**PROCEDURE:**  
1. SOAK BEAN SEEDS IN WATER OVERNIGHT.  
2. PLACE THE SOAKED SEEDS ON DAMP COTTON WOOL AND ALLOW THE RADICLE TO GROW TO APPROXIMATELY 2 CM OVER 1-2 DAYS.  
3. ATTACH THE COTTON WOOL TO CORK DISCS FITTED WITH TWO CLINOSTATS.  
4. PIN THREE OR FOUR GERMINATING BEAN SEEDS ONTO EACH DISC, ENSURING THE RADICLES FACE OUTWARD.  
5. MAINTAIN MOISTURE AROUND THE SEEDS BY COVERING THEM.  
6. POSITION ONE CLINOSTAT ON ITS SIDE AND ACTIVATE IT, WHILE LEAVING THE OTHER CLINOSTAT OFF AS A CONTROL.  
7. REGULARLY WATER THE COTTON WOOL TO KEEP IT DAMP.

**OBSERVATION:**  
AFTER SEVERAL DAYS, OBSERVE THE RADICLE GROWTH:  
- RADICLES ON THE STATIONARY CLINOSTAT WILL GROW DOWNWARD DUE TO GRAVITY.  
- RADICLES ON THE MOVING CLINOSTAT WILL GROW HORIZONTALLY, AS THE CHANGING GRAVITATIONAL STIMULUS NEGATES THE GEOTROPIC RESPONSE.

# PLANT PHYSIOLOGY: CHEMICAL COORDINATION IN PLANTS

## INTRODUCTION TO AUXIN AND PLANT GROWTH

AUXIN IS A CRUCIAL PLANT HORMONE THAT REGULATES GROWTH AND RESPONSES TO ENVIRONMENTAL STIMULI. UNDERSTANDING AUXIN'S ROLE HELPS US COMPREHEND HOW PLANTS ADAPT TO THEIR SURROUNDINGS.

### KEY CONCEPTS ON AUXIN MOVEMENT

AUXIN MOVEMENT WITHIN PLANTS CAN OCCUR THROUGH SEVERAL MECHANISMS:

- **DIFFUSION**: THE PASSIVE MOVEMENT OF AUXIN THROUGH THE PLASMA MEMBRANE.
- **ACTIVE TRANSPORT**: THE ENERGY-DEPENDENT TRANSPORT OF AUXIN VIA PIN PROTEINS IN SPECIFIC DIRECTIONS.
- **OSMOSIS**: THE MOVEMENT OF AUXIN ACROSS CELL MEMBRANES DUE TO CONCENTRATION GRADIENTS.
- **MASS FLOW IN THE PHLOEM**: THE TRANSLOCATION OF AUXIN THROUGH THE VASCULAR TISSUES.

### ENVIRONMENTAL STIMULI AND PLANT GROWTH

PLANTS RESPOND TO VARIOUS STIMULI THAT INFLUENCE GROWTH:

- **SHOOT GROWTH**: LIGHT (PHOTOTROPISM) AND GRAVITY (GRAVITROPISM) ARE PRIMARY STIMULI AFFECTING SHOOT GROWTH.
- **ROOT GROWTH**: ROOTS RESPOND TO GRAVITY AND SOIL MOISTURE LEVELS, WHICH IMPACT THEIR ORIENTATION AND GROWTH.

### BENEFITS OF POSITIVE PHOTOTROPISM

POSITIVE PHOTOTROPISM IN THE STEM ALLOWS PLANTS TO GROW TOWARDS LIGHT. THIS MAXIMIZES PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND ENERGY PRODUCTION, ESSENTIAL FOR GROWTH AND SURVIVAL.

## EXPERIMENT: INVESTIGATING PHOTOTROPISM IN COLEOPTILES

### EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN

AN EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED TO STUDY HOW LIGHT AFFECTS COLEOPTILE GROWTH. THREE TREATMENTS WERE APPLIED:

1. **DISH 1**: DECAPITATED COLEOPTILES, WITH THE TIP REMOVED.
2. **DISH 2**: TIPS COVERED WITH ALUMINUM FOIL CAPS.
3. **DISH 3**: UNTREATED CONTROL GROUP.

EACH BATCH WAS PLACED IN A BOX WITH UNIDIRECTIONAL LIGHT ACCESS.

### EXPECTED OUTCOMES

AFTER 48 HOURS, COLEOPTILE LENGTHS WERE MEASURED. THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE AND GROWTH DIRECTION WERE ANALYZED.

#### PREDICTED FINDINGS:
- **GREATEST INCREASE**: UNTREATED COLEOPTILES EXPECTED TO SHOW THE HIGHEST GROWTH DUE TO FULL LIGHT RESPONSE.
- **LEAST INCREASE**: DECAPITATED COLEOPTILES LIKELY TO SHOW MINIMAL GROWTH, AS AUXIN PRODUCTION IS HINDERED BY TIP REMOVAL.

### GROWTH PATTERNS

- **DECAPITATED COLEOPTILES**: EXPECTED TO GROW VERTICALLY WITH LIMITED LATERAL GROWTH.
- **FOIL-CAPPED COLEOPTILES**: REDUCED GROWTH ON FOIL-COVERED SIDES, LEADING TO UNEVEN GROWTH.
- **UNTREATED COLEOPTILES**: LIKELY TO BEND TOWARDS LIGHT, DEMONSTRATING POSITIVE PHOTOTROPISM.

### SIGNIFICANCE OF GROWTH MEASUREMENT

USING PERCENTAGE INCREASE ALLOWS FOR STANDARDIZED COMPARISON, ACCOUNTING FOR INITIAL COLEOPTILE SIZES. THIS METHOD ENSURES FAIR ASSESSMENT ACROSS TREATMENTS DESPITE VARIATIONS IN INITIAL LENGTH.

## CONCLUSION

UNDERSTANDING AUXIN ROLES AND LIGHT EFFECTS ON GROWTH IS FUNDAMENTAL TO PLANT PHYSIOLOGY. EXPERIMENTS LIKE THIS PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO PLANT ADAPTATION, CRUCIAL FOR SURVIVAL AND GROWTH.
