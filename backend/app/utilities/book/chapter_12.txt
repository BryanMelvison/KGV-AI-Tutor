# 12 CHEMICAL COORDINATION IN PLANTS

Plants can detect changes in their environment and respond to them, but the responses are much slower than those in animals. This is because movements in a plant are brought about by changes in the plant's growth. This chapter is about these growth responses, and the chemicals that coordinate them.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

- Understand that plants respond to stimuli
- Describe the phototropic response of roots and stems
- Describe the geotropic responses of roots and stems
- Understand the role of auxin in the phototropic response of stems

Chapter 6 explains how animals detect and respond to changes in their environment. Animals usually respond very quickly – for example the reflex action resulting from a painful stimulus (page 83) is over in a fraction of a second.

As in animals, some species of plant can respond rapidly to a stimulus, for example the Venus flytrap (Figure 12.1). This plant has modified leaves, which close quickly around their 'prey', trapping it. The plant then secretes enzymes to digest the insect. The movement is brought about by rapid changes in turgor of specialised cells at the base of the leaves.

Figure 12.1 The Venus flytrap catches and digests insects to gain extra nutrients. The plant responds very quickly to a fly landing on one of its leaves.

## TROPISMS

Most plants do not respond to stimuli as quickly as the Venus flytrap, because their response normally involves a change in their rate of growth. Different parts of plants may grow at different rates, and a plant may respond to a stimulus by increasing growth near the tip of its shoot or roots.

Imagine a plant growing normally in a pot. Usually, most light will be falling on the plant from above. If you turn the plant on its side and leave it for a day or so, you will see that its shoot starts to grow upwards (Figure 12.2).

Figure 12.2 This bean has responded to being placed horizontally. The growing shoot has started to bend upwards.

There are two stimuli acting on the plant in Figure 12.2. One is the direction of the light that falls on the plant. The other stimulus is gravity. Both light and gravity are directional stimuli (they act in a particular direction). The growth response of a plant to a directional stimulus is called a **tropism**. If the growth response is towards the direction of the stimulus, it is a positive tropism, and if it is away from the direction of the stimulus, it is a negative tropism. The stem of the plant in Figure 12.2 is showing a positive **phototropism** and a negative **geotropism**, which both make the stem grow upwards.

The aerial part of a plant (the 'shoot') needs light to carry out photosynthesis. This means that in most species, a positive phototropism is the strongest tropic response of the shoot. If a shoot grows towards the light, it ensures that the leaves, held out at an angle to the stem, will receive the maximum amount of sunlight. This response is easily seen in any plant placed near a window, or another source of 'one-way' or unidirectional light (Figure 12.3).

In darkness or uniform light, the shoot shows a negative geotropism. As you might expect, the roots of plants are strongly positively geotropic. This response makes sure that the roots grow down into the soil, where they can reach water and mineral ions. Roots also fix a plant firmly in place – they provide 'anchorage'.

The roots of some species that have been studied are also negatively phototropic, but most roots don't respond to directional light at all. Table 12.1 summarises the main tropisms.

Table 12.1: The main responses of plants to directional stimuli (tropisms).

| Stimulus | Name of response | Response of shoots | Response of roots |
|----------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| light | phototropism | grow towards light source (positive phototropism) | most species show no response; some grow away from light (negative phototropism) |
| gravity | geotropism | grow away from direction of gravity (negative geotropism) | grow towards direction of gravity (positive geotropism) |

## DETECTING THE LIGHT STIMULUS – PLANT HORMONES

Plants do not have the obvious sense organs and nervous system of animals. However, since they respond to stimuli such as light and gravity, they must have some way of detecting them and coordinating the response. The detection system of phototropism was first investigated by the great English biologist Charles Darwin (see Chapter 19) in the late nineteenth century. Instead of using stems, Darwin (and later scientists) used cereal coleoptiles, which are easier to grow and use in experiments.

A **coleoptile** is a protective sheath that covers the first leaves of a cereal seedling. It protects the delicate leaves as the shoot emerges through the soil (Figure 12.4). Coleoptiles have a simple structure and are easy to grow, so they are often used to investigate tropisms.

### KEY POINT
- Phototropisms are growth responses to light from one direction. Geotropisms are growth responses to the direction of gravity ('geo' refers to the Earth).

### KEY POINT
- Light from one direction is called 'unidirectional'. If light shines on the plant evenly from all directions, this is called 'uniform' light.

### EXTENSION WORK
Charles Darwin is best known for his theory of evolution by natural selection (Chapter 19). However, he carried out research in other areas of biology, including studying plant hormones. You could do some research to find out more about his life and work. Make a list of his achievements.
---
Darwin showed that the stimulus of unidirectional light was detected by the tip of the coleoptile, and transmitted to a growth zone, just behind the tip (Figure 12.5).

Figure 12.5 Darwin's experiments with phototropism (1880)

| Stage | Description | Result |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| (a) | coleoptile before experiment | Straight growth |
| (b) | intact coleoptile | Shows growth and curvature towards the light |
| (c) | coleoptile with tip removed | Shows no growth or bending |
| (d) | coleoptile with tip covered by opaque cap | Shows growth but no bending |

The figure shows the direction of light coming from the right side in all cases.

Since plants don't have a nervous system, biologists began to look for a chemical messenger (or plant hormone) that might be the cause of phototropism in coleoptiles. Between 1910 and 1926 several scientists investigated this problem. Some of their results are summarised in Figure 12.6.

Experiment 1

| Condition | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| tip of coleoptile removed | - |
| tip replaced on mica sheet | no bending |
| tip replaced on gelatine block | normal bending towards light |

The figure shows the direction of light coming from the right side.

Experiment 2

| Condition | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| tip removed | No bending |
| tip replaced on one side | - |
| - | bending occurs without unilateral light stimulus |

These experiments demonstrate the role of the coleoptile tip in detecting light and initiating the bending response, as well as the potential involvement of a chemical messenger in transmitting the signal from the tip to the growth zone.

## Experiment 3

1. Tip removed and placed on agar block for several hours
2. Tip discarded and agar block placed on one side of decapitated coleoptile
3. Bending occurs in absence of unidirectional light

Figure 12.6 Experiments on coleoptiles that helped to explain the mechanism of phototropism.

In experiment 1, the stimulus for growth was found to pass through materials such as gelatine, which absorbs water-soluble chemicals, but not through materials such as mica (a mineral), which is impermeable to water. This made biologists think that the stimulus was a chemical that was soluble in water.

In experiment 2, it was shown that the phototropic response could be brought about, even without unidirectional light, by removing a coleoptile tip ('decapitating' the coleoptile) and placing the tip on one side of the decapitated stalk.

In experiment 3, it was found that the hormone could be collected in another water-absorbing material (a block of agar jelly). Placing the agar block on one side of the decapitated coleoptile stalk caused it to bend.

Investigations like experiments 2 and 3 led scientists to believe that the hormone caused bending by stimulating growth on the side of the coleoptile furthest from the light. The theory is that the hormone is produced in the tip of the shoot, and diffuses back down the shoot. If the shoot is in the dark, or if light is all around the shoot, the hormone diffuses at equal rates on each side of the shoot, so it stimulates the shoot equally on all sides. However, if the shoot is receiving light from one direction, the hormone moves away from the light as it diffuses downwards. The higher concentration of hormone on the 'dark' side of the shoot stimulates cells there to grow, making the shoot bend towards the light (Figure 12.7).

[Diagram showing how plant hormone causes phototropism]

Figure 12.7 How movement of a plant hormone causes phototropism.

Since these experiments were carried out, scientists have identified the hormone responsible. It is called auxin. Several other types of plant hormone have been found. Like auxin, they all influence growth and development of plants in one way or another, so that many scientists prefer to call them plant growth substances rather than plant hormones.

### EXTENSION WORK

'Auxin' should really be 'auxins', since there are a number of chemicals with very similar structures making up a group of closely related plant hormones.

### EXTENSION WORK

As well as auxins, there are four other main groups of plant hormones, called gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid and ethene. They control many aspects of plant growth and development, apart from tropisms. These include growth of buds, leaves and fruit, fruit ripening, seed germination, leaf fall and opening of stomata, to name just a few.

## USING A CLINOSTAT TO SHOW TROPISMS

A clinostat is a piece of apparatus consisting of an electric motor turning a cork disc. Germinating seeds are attached to the disc. The motor turns the disc and seeds around very slowly, so that the movement eliminates the effect of any directional stimulus that may be acting on the seeds. The clinostat can be turned through 90°, so that the disc rotates either horizontally or vertically.
