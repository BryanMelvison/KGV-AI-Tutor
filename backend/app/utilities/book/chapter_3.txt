# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: BREATHING AND GAS EXCHANGE

WHEN WE BREATHE, AIR IS MOVED IN AND OUT OF THE LUNGS, FACILITATING GAS EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE AIR AND THE BLOOD. THIS PROCESS IS ESSENTIAL FOR SURVIVAL, BUT IT CAN ALSO BE COMPROMISED BY LIFESTYLE FACTORS SUCH AS SMOKING, WHICH DAMAGES THE LUNGS AND IMPAIRS THEIR FUNCTION.

THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM, OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE GAS EXCHANGE SYSTEM, CONSISTS OF SEVERAL KEY STRUCTURES THAT WORK TOGETHER TO ENABLE BREATHING. THESE STRUCTURES INCLUDE THE RIBCAGE, DIAPHRAGM, INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES, TRACHEA, BRONCHI, BRONCHIOLES, AND ALVEOLI. THE DIAPHRAGM IS A MUSCULAR SHEET THAT SEPARATES THE THORAX FROM THE ABDOMEN, PLAYING A CRUCIAL ROLE IN VENTILATION BY COORDINATING WITH THE INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES TO MOVE AIR INTO AND OUT OF THE LUNGS.

RESPIRATION REFERS TO THE BIOLOGICAL PROCESS WHERE OXYGEN IS EXTRACTED FROM THE AIR AND CARBON DIOXIDE IS RELEASED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE THROUGH BREATHING. THIS PROCESS IS VITAL FOR CELLULAR RESPIRATION, WHICH CONVERTS GLUCOSE INTO ENERGY. BREATHING, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS THE MECHANICAL ACT OF MOVING AIR IN AND OUT OF THE LUNGS, ENSURING THAT GAS EXCHANGE CAN OCCUR.

THE ALVEOLI ARE SMALL SACS AT THE END OF THE BRONCHIOLES WHERE GAS EXCHANGE BY DIFFUSION OCCURS BETWEEN THE AIR IN THE LUNGS AND THE BLOOD IN CAPILLARIES. THIS PROCESS IS HIGHLY EFFICIENT, ALLOWING OXYGEN TO BE ABSORBED INTO THE BLOODSTREAM AND CARBON DIOXIDE TO BE EXPELLED DURING EXHALATION.

UNDERSTANDING THESE STRUCTURES AND PROCESSES IS FUNDAMENTAL TO GRASPING HOW BREATHING WORKS AND HOW LIFESTYLE CHOICES LIKE SMOKING CAN IMPACT RESPIRATORY HEALTH. SMOKING LEADS TO DAMAGE IN THE ALVEOLI, REDUCING THEIR SURFACE AREA FOR GAS EXCHANGE AND INCREASING THE RISK OF CHRONIC RESPIRATORY CONDITIONS SUCH AS COPD AND CORONARY HEART DISEASE.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: BREATHING AND GAS EXCHANGE

## THE HUMAN GAS EXCHANGE SYSTEM

THE HUMAN GAS EXCHANGE SYSTEM FACILITATES BREATHING AND ENABLES THE EXCHANGE OF GASES BETWEEN THE BODY AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS SYSTEM IS STRUCTURED AS A HIGHLY BRANCHED NETWORK OF AIR PASSAGES, REFERRED TO AS THE **BRONCHIAL TREE**.

### STRUCTURE OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM

1. **TRACHEA**: THE TRACHEA SERVES AS THE PRIMARY AIRWAY, BRANCHING INTO TWO TUBES KNOWN AS **BRONCHI**, EACH LEADING TO ONE LUNG.
2. **BRONCHI AND BRONCHIOLES**: EACH BRONCHUS FURTHER DIVIDES INTO SMALLER TUBES CALLED **BRONCHIOLES**, WHICH TERMINATE IN MICROSCOPIC AIR SACS CALLED **ALVEOLI** (PLURAL: ALVEOLI). GAS EXCHANGE OCCURS WITHIN THESE ALVEOLI.
3. **CARTILAGE SUPPORT**: THE TRACHEA CONTAINS C-SHAPED RINGS OF CARTILAGE, ALLOWING FLEXIBILITY WHILE PROVIDING STRUCTURAL SUPPORT. THESE RINGS FACE THE ESOPHAGUS TO PREVENT OBSTRUCTION DURING BREATHING.

### THE ROLE OF THE PLEURAL MEMBRANES

THE PLEURAL MEMBRANES FORM AN AIRTIGHT SEAL AROUND THE LUNGS, CREATING THE PLEURAL CAVITY FILLED WITH PLEURAL FLUID. THIS FLUID LUBRICATES THE LUNG SURFACES, PREVENTING ADHESION TO THE CHEST WALL DURING BREATHING.

### AIRWAY CLEANING MECHANISMS

1. **MUCUS PRODUCTION**: THE AIRWAYS ARE LINED WITH CELLS THAT SECRETE MUCUS, TRAPPING DUST AND BACTERIA.
2. **CILIARY MOTION**: SPECIALIZED CELLS EQUIPPED WITH CILIA SWEEP MUCUS AND TRAPPED PARTICLES TOWARDS THE MOUTH, MAINTAINING AIRWAY CLEANLINESS.

### BREATHING PROCESS

WHEN BREATHING, AIR IS INHALED THROUGH THE NOSE OR MOUTH, TRAVELING DOWN THE TRACHEA. THE BRONCHI FURTHER DIVIDE INTO BRONCHIOLES, LEADING TO ALVEOLI WHERE GAS EXCHANGE OCCURS.

### SUMMARY OF GAS EXCHANGE COMPONENTS

- **TRACHEA**: MAIN AIRWAY LEADING TO THE LUNGS.
- **BRONCHI**: TWO MAIN BRANCHES FROM THE TRACHEA.
- **BRONCHIOLES**: SMALLER TUBES LEADING TO ALVEOLI FOR GAS EXCHANGE.
- **ALVEOLI**: MICROSCOPIC SACS WHERE GAS EXCHANGE OCCURS.
- **PLEURAL MEMBRANES**: PROTECT AND LUBRICATE THE LUNGS.
- **MUCUS AND CILIA**: MAINTAIN AIRWAY CLEANLINESS.

THIS STRUCTURED APPROACH ENSURES A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE HUMAN GAS EXCHANGE SYSTEM, FOCUSING ON ITS COMPONENTS AND FUNCTIONS WITHOUT ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY OR SUMMARIES.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: BREATHING AND GAS EXCHANGE

## VENTILATION OF THE LUNGS

VENTILATION REFERS TO THE PROCESS OF MOVING AIR IN AND OUT OF THE LUNGS THROUGH DIFFERENCES IN AIR PRESSURE. THIS PROCESS OCCURS WITHIN THE THORAX, AN AIRTIGHT CAVITY, WHERE BREATHING CHANGES ITS VOLUME, ALTERING INTERNAL PRESSURE AND FACILITATING AIRFLOW.

### MECHANISMS OF VENTILATION

THE PRIMARY MOVEMENTS INVOLVED IN VENTILATION ARE THOSE OF THE RIBS AND DIAPHRAGM.

1. **INHALATION**:
   - DURING INHALATION, THE EXTERNAL INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES CONTRACT, PULLING THE RIBS UPWARD AND OUTWARD.
   - SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE DIAPHRAGM CONTRACTS AND FLATTENS, INCREASING THE CHEST CAVITY VOLUME.
   - THIS VOLUME INCREASE LOWERS INTRATHORACIC PRESSURE, ALLOWING AIR TO ENTER THE LUNGS.

2. **EXHALATION**:
   - DURING EXHALATION, THE EXTERNAL INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES RELAX, WHILE THE INTERNAL INTERCOSTALS CONTRACT, PULLING THE RIBS DOWNWARD AND INWARD.
   - THE DIAPHRAGM ALSO RELAXES, REVERTING TO ITS DOME SHAPE, REDUCING THORACIC VOLUME.
   - THIS VOLUME REDUCTION INCREASES INTRATHORACIC PRESSURE, FORCING AIR OUT OF THE LUNGS.

### ROLE OF CILIA

CILIA LINING THE TRACHEA TRAP DUST AND PATHOGENS. THEIR DESTRUCTION BY SMOKING IMPAIRS THIS FUNCTION, ALLOWING HARMFUL SUBSTANCES TO ENTER THE LUNGS AND INCREASING RESPIRATORY RISK.

## SUMMARY

- **INHALATION**: INVOLVES CONTRACTIONS OF EXTERNAL INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES AND DIAPHRAGM, INCREASING THORACIC VOLUME AND LOWERING PRESSURE TO ALLOW AIR ENTRY.
- **EXHALATION**: INVOLVES RELAXATION OF EXTERNAL INTERCOSTALS AND DIAPHRAGM, DECREASING THORACIC VOLUME AND RAISING PRESSURE TO EXPEL AIR.
- **CILIA**: ESSENTIAL FOR TRAPPING HARMFUL PARTICLES; SMOKING DISRUPTS THEIR FUNCTION, LEADING TO RESPIRATORY ISSUES.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: BREATHING AND GAS EXCHANGE

## BREATHING PROCESS

BREATHING CONSISTS OF TWO PRIMARY ACTIONS: **INHALATION** AND **EXHALATION**.

### INHALATION
DURING INHALATION, AIR IS DRAWN INTO THE LUNGS DUE TO THE CONTRACTION OF THE DIAPHRAGM MUSCLES. THIS ACTION FLATTENS THE DIAPHRAGM, CREATING A LOWER PRESSURE IN THE THORACIC CAVITY, WHICH ALLOWS AIR TO ENTER THE LUNGS. SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE EXTERNAL INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES CONTRACT, LIFTING AND EXPANDING THE RIBCAGE, INCREASING THE VOLUME OF THE THORACIC CAVITY.

### EXHALATION
EXHALATION INVOLVES THE RELAXATION OF THE DIAPHRAGM MUSCLES, CAUSING THE DIAPHRAGM TO ARCH UPWARDS AND INCREASE INTRATHORACIC PRESSURE. THIS PRESSURE FORCES AIR OUT OF THE LUNGS AS THE INTERNAL INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES CONTRACT, PULLING THE RIBS DOWNWARD AND TOGETHER.

### KEY POINT
THE PROCESS OF BREATHING RELIES ON CHANGES IN PRESSURE RATHER THAN ACTIVE FORCE. JUST AS A BICYCLE PUMP COMPRESSES AIR, THE LUNGS EXPAND AND CONTRACT BASED ON INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PRESSURE DIFFERENCES.

## GAS EXCHANGE IN THE ALVEOLI

GAS EXCHANGE OCCURS WITHIN THE ALVEOLI, TINY AIR SACS IN THE LUNGS. UNDERSTANDING THIS PROCESS REQUIRES COMPARING ATMOSPHERIC AIR WITH EXHALED AIR.

### COMPOSITION OF ATMOSPHERIC AND EXHALED AIR
ATMOSPHERIC AIR CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF NITROGEN (78%), OXYGEN (21%), CARBON DIOXIDE (0.04%), AND OTHER GASES LIKE ARGON. EXHALED AIR RETAINS MOST NITROGEN (79%) BUT SHOWS A DECREASE IN OXYGEN (16%) AND AN INCREASE IN CARBON DIOXIDE, REFLECTING ITS PRODUCTION IN THE BODY.

### IMPORTANT NOTES
THE PERCENTAGE OF A GAS IN A MIXTURE CAN BE MISLEADING. FOR EXAMPLE, IF ALL OXYGEN IS ABSORBED, NITROGEN BECOMES 100% BY VOLUME, THOUGH ITS ACTUAL AMOUNT REMAINS UNCHANGED. EXHALED AIR IS WARMER AND SATURATED WITH WATER VAPOR, VARYING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS.

### FUNCTION OF ALVEOLI
ALVEOLI FACILITATE EFFICIENT GAS EXCHANGE THROUGH THEIR STRUCTURE:
- THEY PROVIDE A VAST SURFACE AREA (APPROXIMATELY 60 SQUARE METERS), SURPASSING THE FLOOR AREA OF AN AVERAGE CLASSROOM.
- SURROUNDING ALVEOLI ARE TINY BLOOD CAPILLARIES, ENABLING OXYGEN ABSORPTION INTO THE BLOODSTREAM AND CARBON DIOXIDE EXPULSION.

### STRUCTURE OF ALVEOLI
ALVEOLI RESEMBLE BUNCHES OF GRAPES UNDER A MICROSCOPE, CONFIRMING THEIR ROLE IN GAS EXCHANGE.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: BREATHING AND GAS EXCHANGE

## OVERVIEW OF ALVEOLI AND GAS EXCHANGE

THE PROCESS OF BREATHING AND GAS EXCHANGE IS ESSENTIAL FOR MAINTAINING LIFE IN ANIMALS. THIS PROCESS OCCURS PRIMARILY IN THE LUNGS, WHERE TINY AIR SACS CALLED ALVEOLI FACILITATE GAS EXCHANGE.

### STRUCTURE OF ALVEOLI

EACH ALVEOLUS HAS A WALL COMPOSED OF CELLS, WHICH IS CRUCIAL FOR GAS EXCHANGE. SURROUNDING EACH ALVEOLUS IS A NETWORK OF CAPILLARIES, TINY BLOOD VESSELS THAT PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE PROCESS.

### THE PROCESS OF GAS EXCHANGE

BLOOD THAT IS LOW IN OXYGEN AND HIGH IN CARBON DIOXIDE IS PUMPED FROM THE HEART TO THE LUNGS. AS THIS BLOOD PASSES THROUGH THE CAPILLARIES SURROUNDING THE ALVEOLI, IT IS SEPARATED FROM THE AIR INSIDE THE ALVEOLI BY ONLY TWO CELL LAYERS. THIS SEPARATION ALLOWS FOR THE DIFFUSION OF GASES BETWEEN THE AIR IN THE ALVEOLUS AND THE BLOOD IN THE CAPILLARIES.

- **OXYGEN**: THE CONCENTRATION OF OXYGEN IN THE ALVEOLUS IS HIGHER THAN IN THE BLOOD, SO OXYGEN DIFFUSES FROM THE ALVEOLUS INTO THE BLOOD.
- **CARBON DIOXIDE**: CONVERSELY, THE CONCENTRATION OF CARBON DIOXIDE IN THE BLOOD IS HIGHER THAN IN THE AIR, SO CARBON DIOXIDE DIFFUSES FROM THE BLOOD INTO THE ALVEOLUS.

### ROLE OF FLUID IN ALVEOLI

A THIN LAYER OF FLUID LINES THE INSIDE OF THE ALVEOLI, WHICH COMES FROM THE BLOOD. THIS FLUID FACILITATES THE DIFFUSION PROCESS BY PROVIDING A MOIST SURFACE FOR OXYGEN TO DISSOLVE BEFORE IT PASSES THROUGH THE ALVEOLAR WALL INTO THE BLOOD.

### RESULT OF GAS EXCHANGE

AFTER GAS EXCHANGE, THE BLOOD THAT LEAVES THE CAPILLARIES IS RICH IN OXYGEN AND FREE OF CARBON DIOXIDE. THIS OXYGENATED BLOOD IS THEN PUMPED BACK TO THE HEART, WHERE IT CIRCULATES THROUGHOUT THE BODY TO SUPPLY RESPIRING CELLS WITH THE NECESSARY OXYGEN.

### IMPORTANT NOTE

IT IS INCORRECT TO DESCRIBE THE ALVEOLUS AS HAVING CELL WALLS. INSTEAD, IT SHOULD BE STATED THAT THE ALVEOLUS HAS A WALL MADE OF CELLS.

### EXTENSION WORK

CONSIDERING THE DIFFUSION GRADIENTS FOR BOTH OXYGEN AND CARBON DIOXIDE CAN ENHANCE UNDERSTANDING OF THIS ESSENTIAL PROCESS. THE EFFICIENCY OF GAS EXCHANGE IN THE ALVEOLI IS VITAL FOR THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM'S FUNCTION AND OVERALL ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: BREATHING AND GAS EXCHANGE

## ACTIVITY 1: COMPARING CARBON DIOXIDE CONTENT IN INHALED AND EXHALED AIR

**SAFETY NOTE:** WEAR EYE PROTECTION AND BREATHE GENTLY. USE A CLEAN MOUTHPIECE FOR EACH PARTICIPANT.

THE APPARATUS SHOWN IN **FIGURE 3.8** ALLOWS COMPARISON OF CARBON DIOXIDE LEVELS IN INHALED AND EXHALED AIR. A PERSON BREATHES GENTLY THROUGH THE CENTRAL TUBE, WITH EXHALED AIR PASSING THROUGH ONE TUBE CONTAINING AN INDICATOR SOLUTION AND INHALED AIR DRAWN THROUGH ANOTHER.

- IF LIMEWATER IS USED, THE 'EXHALED' TUBE'S SOLUTION WILL TURN CLOUDY BEFORE THE 'INHALED' TUBE'S.
- USING HYDROGEN CARBONATE SOLUTION CHANGES IT FROM RED TO YELLOW.

!FIGURE 3.8: APPARATUS FOR EXPERIMENT 1

---

## ACTIVITY 2: INVESTIGATING THE EFFECT OF EXERCISE ON BREATHING RATE

**SAFETY NOTE:** WEAR SUITABLE FOOTWEAR AND USE A STURDY, SECURE SURFACE LIKE A LOW BOX OR PE BENCH.

TO DEMONSTRATE EXERCISE'S IMPACT ON BREATHING RATE:

1. **RESTING MEASUREMENT:**
   - SIT QUIETLY FOR FIVE MINUTES, ENSURING RELAXATION.
   - COUNT BREATHS IN ONE MINUTE AND RECORD THE RESULT.
   - REPEAT UNTIL A STEADY RESTING RATE IS CONSISTENTLY OBSERVED.

2. **EXERCISE MEASUREMENT:**
   - AFTER RESTING, PERFORM VIGOROUS EXERCISE, SUCH AS RUNNING IN PLACE FOR THREE MINUTES.
   - IMMEDIATELY POST-EXERCISE, SIT AND RECORD BREATHING RATE AS BEFORE.
   - CONTINUE RECORDING BREATHS PER MINUTE UNTIL THE RATE RETURNS TO THE RESTING LEVEL.

BY CONDUCTING THESE ACTIVITIES, STUDENTS GAIN A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF BREATHING MECHANICS AND GAS EXCHANGE IN RELATION TO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: BREATHING AND GAS EXCHANGE

## BREATHING RATE INVESTIGATION

THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS BREATHING RATE DATA COLLECTED FROM TWO GIRLS, A AND B, BEFORE AND AFTER EXERCISE:

| TIME FROM START OF EXPERIMENT (MIN) | BREATHING RATE (BREATHS PER MIN) |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 0                                    | 13                                |
| 1                                    | 14                                |
| 2                                    | 14                                |
| 3                                    | 28                                |
| 4                                    | 24                                |
| 5                                    | 17                                |
| 6                                    | 12                                |
| 7                                    | 10                                |
| 8                                    | 14                                |
| 9                                    | 12                                |

BEFORE EXERCISE, BOTH GIRLS HAD A BASELINE BREATHING RATE OF 13 BREATHS PER MINUTE. WITHIN THE FIRST TWO MINUTES, THEIR RATES REMAINED STABLE AT 14 BREATHS PER MINUTE. AT THREE MINUTES, GIRL A'S BREATHING RATE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY TO 28 BREATHS PER MINUTE, WHILE GIRL B'S RATE ROSE TO 24 BREATHS PER MINUTE.

AFTER EXERCISE, BOTH GIRLS' BREATHING RATES GRADUALLY DECREASED BUT DID NOT RETURN TO BASELINE LEVELS IMMEDIATELY. GIRL A'S RATE DROPPED TO 17 BREATHS PER MINUTE BY FIVE MINUTES AND FURTHER DECREASED TO 12 BY SIX MINUTES, STABILIZING AT 10 BREATHS PER MINUTE BY SEVEN MINUTES. GIRL B'S RATE ALSO DECREASED BUT REMAINED HIGHER THAN GIRL A'S POST-EXERCISE LEVELS.

THE DATA INDICATES THAT BOTH GIRLS EXPERIENCED A PRONOUNCED INCREASE IN BREATHING RATE DURING EXERCISE, WITH GIRL A SHOWING A MORE SUBSTANTIAL RISE COMPARED TO GIRL B. THIS SUGGESTS THAT GIRL A MAY POSSESS GREATER CARDIOVASCULAR EFFICIENCY OR MUSCLE ENDURANCE, ALLOWING HER TO SUSTAIN HIGHER ACTIVITY LEVELS BEFORE NEEDING TO RECOVER.

## THE EFFECTS OF SMOKING

FOR EFFECTIVE GAS EXCHANGE, THE AIR PASSAGES MUST REMAIN CLEAR. THE ALVEOLI RELY ON MUCUS AND CILIA TO REMOVE DIRT PARTICLES AND BACTERIA, ENSURING A LARGE SURFACE AREA FOR OXYGEN AND CARBON DIOXIDE EXCHANGE. HOWEVER, SMOKING DISRUPTS THESE PROCESSES.

SMOKING IS ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERAL HEALTH RISKS, INCLUDING LUNG CANCER, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA, CORONARY HEART DISEASE, AND STOMACH ULCERS. ADDITIONALLY, PREGNANT WOMEN WHO SMOKE ARE AT HIGHER RISK OF DELIVERING UNDERWEIGHT BABIES DUE TO REDUCED PLACENTAL FUNCTION.

THE TRACHEA AND BRONCHI OF SMOKERS SUFFER DAMAGE FROM CIGARETTE SMOKE, WHICH DESTROYS CILIA AND IMPAIRS LUNG FUNCTION. THIS MAKES THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO INFECTIONS, FURTHER COMPLICATING GAS EXCHANGE EFFICIENCY.

## FURTHER STUDY

CORONARY HEART DISEASE WILL BE DISCUSSED IN CHAPTER 5 AFTER STUDYING THE HEART'S STRUCTURE. UNDERSTANDING THE MEDICAL CONDITIONS CAUSED BY SMOKING AND THE IMPORTANCE OF HEALTHY LUNGS IS CRUCIAL FOR EFFECTIVE GAS EXCHANGE.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: EMPHYSEMA AND LUNG HEALTH

## EMPHYSEMA

EMPHYSEMA IS A SERIOUS LUNG DISEASE CHARACTERIZED BY DAMAGE TO THE ALVEOLI, TINY AIR SACS ESSENTIAL FOR GAS EXCHANGE. IN INDIVIDUALS WITH EMPHYSEMA, THE ALVEOLAR WALLS BREAK DOWN AND FUSE, CREATING ENLARGED, IRREGULAR AIR SPACES. THIS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES THE SURFACE AREA AVAILABLE FOR GAS EXCHANGE, LEADING TO LESS EFFICIENT OXYGEN ABSORPTION. CONSEQUENTLY, THE BLOOD OF SOMEONE WITH EMPHYSEMA CARRIES LESS OXYGEN, IMPAIRING EVEN MILD PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES LIKE WALKING.

### KEY ASPECTS OF EMPHYSEMA
- **CAUSE**: PRIMARILY SMOKING.
- **SYMPTOMS**: DIFFICULTY BREATHING, REDUCED EXERCISE CAPACITY, AND A PERSISTENT COUGH.
- **STATISTICS**: APPROXIMATELY 20,000 DEATHS ANNUALLY IN BRITAIN FROM EMPHYSEMA.
- **TREATMENT**: NO CURE; PATIENTS OFTEN REQUIRE SUPPLEMENTAL OXYGEN.

!ALVEOLI IN A NORMAL LUNG
*FIGURE 3.9: THE ALVEOLI OF AN INDIVIDUAL WITH EMPHYSEMA SHOW REDUCED SURFACE AREA AND INEFFICIENT GAS EXCHANGE.*

!PATIENTS WITH EMPHYSEMA
*FIGURE 3.10: PATIENTS WITH EMPHYSEMA MAY NEED TO BREATHE ENRICHED OXYGEN TO SURVIVE.*

## CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD)

CHRONIC BRONCHITIS COMBINED WITH EMPHYSEMA DEFINES COPD, A PROGRESSIVE DISEASE WITHOUT A CURE AND LEADING TO SEVERE HEALTH COMPLICATIONS OVER TIME.

## BREATHING AND GAS EXCHANGE

SMOKING REDUCES LUNG CILIA, IMPAIRING MUCUS CLEARANCE. THIS MUCUS BLOCKS AIR PASSAGES, CAUSING BRONCHIAL TREE IRRITATION AND INCREASING INFECTION RISK. THE PERSISTENT "SMOKER'S COUGH" IS OFTEN DUE TO THIS STICKY MUCUS.

### BRONCHITIS
BRONCHITIS OCCURS WHEN AIRWAYS BECOME INFLAMED, PRODUCING EXCESS MUCUS THAT OBSTRUCTS AIRFLOW, MAKING BREATHING DIFFICULT.

## LUNG CANCER AND SMOKING

EVIDENCE LINKING SMOKING TO LUNG CANCER EMERGED IN THE 1950S. A STUDY COMPARING LUNG CANCER PATIENTS TO A CONTROL GROUP REVEALED HIGHER SMOKING PREVALENCE AMONG CANCER PATIENTS, ESTABLISHING A CLEAR LINK BETWEEN SMOKING AND LUNG CANCER RISK.

### CONTEXTUAL UNDERSTANDING
- **COPD**: PROGRESSIVE COMBINATION OF CHRONIC BRONCHITIS AND EMPHYSEMA.
- **EMPHYSEMA**: ALVEOLAR DAMAGE REDUCING GAS EXCHANGE EFFICIENCY.
- **BRONCHITIS**: INFLAMMATION FROM MUCUS OBSTRUCTION.
- **LUNG CANCER**: STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH SMOKING, AS SHOWN BY HISTORICAL STUDIES.

PROMOTING LUNG HEALTH THROUGH UNDERSTANDING THESE CONDITIONS IS CRUCIAL FOR REDUCING SMOKING-RELATED RISKS.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: BREATHING AND GAS EXCHANGE

## SMOKING AND LUNG CANCER

### OVERVIEW OF SMOKING HABITS
A STUDY COMPARING SMOKING HABITS AMONG LUNG CANCER PATIENTS AND CONTROL PATIENTS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN SMOKING BEHAVIOR. AMONG LUNG CANCER PATIENTS, 0.5% WERE NON-SMOKERS, WHILE 25% SMOKED MORE THAN 15 CIGARETTES DAILY. IN CONTRAST, 4.5% OF CONTROL PATIENTS WERE NON-SMOKERS, WITH 13% SMOKING OVER 15 CIGARETTES PER DAY.

### CORRELATION BETWEEN SMOKING AND LUNG CANCER
THE STUDY FOUND A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION BETWEEN SMOKING AND LUNG CANCER. OVER 20 SIMILAR INVESTIGATIONS IN NINE COUNTRIES HAVE CONSISTENTLY SHOWN THESE RESULTS. IN 1962, THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS PUBLISHED A REPORT TITLED "SMOKING AND HEALTH," WARNING ABOUT SMOKING'S DANGERS. THIS LED TO A NOTABLE DECLINE IN LUNG CANCER DEATHS AMONG MALE DOCTORS, DROPPING BY 38%, WHILE OVERALL MALE DEATH RATES ROSE.

### THE DANGERS OF CIGARETTE SMOKE
CIGARETTE SMOKE CONTAINS OVER 7,000 CHEMICALS, MANY HARMFUL. KEY SUBSTANCES INCLUDE NICOTINE, A HIGHLY ADDICTIVE DRUG, AND MORE THAN 60 CARCINOGENS SUCH AS FORMALDEHYDE, CYANIDE, BENZENE, TOLUENE, CARBON MONOXIDE, ARSENIC, AND AMMONIA. THESE CARCINOGENS ACCUMULATE IN LUNG TAR, LEADING TO CELL MUTATIONS AND TUMORS. LUNG TUMORS OFTEN CAUSE NO PAIN, LEADING TO LATE DIAGNOSES WHEN CANCER MAY HAVE SPREAD, MAKING IT INOPERABLE.

### RISK FACTORS
SMOKING INCREASES LUNG CANCER RISK, WITH THE RISK RISING SIGNIFICANTLY WITH THE NUMBER OF CIGARETTES SMOKED. SMOKING 20 DAILY CAN INCREASE DEATH RISK BY ABOUT 15 TIMES.

!FIGURE 3.12: INCREASED RISK OF LUNG CANCER DEATH WITH HIGHER CIGARETTE CONSUMPTION.

### DID YOU KNOW?
PEOPLE OFTEN REFER TO "YELLOW NICOTINE STAINS," BUT IT'S ACTUALLY TAR THAT STAINS FINGERS AND TEETH. NICOTINE IS COLORLESS AND ODORLESS, AND THE CIGARETTE TYPE (FILTERED OR LOW TAR) HAS MINIMAL IMPACT ON LUNG CANCER RISK.

### TAKING ACTION
THE BEST ACTION IS NOT SMOKING AT ALL. FOR EXISTING SMOKERS, QUITTING CAN IMPROVE SURVIVAL CHANCES, APPROACHING THAT OF NON-SMOKERS AFTER A FEW YEARS OF CESSATION.

!FIGURE 3.13: QUITTING SMOKING IMPROVES SURVIVAL CHANCES.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: BREATHING AND GAS EXCHANGE

## THE IMPACT OF SMOKING ON HEALTH

### DEATH RATES FROM LUNG CANCER
FIGURE 3.13 ILLUSTRATES DEATH RATES FROM LUNG CANCER AMONG SMOKERS, NON-SMOKERS, AND EX-SMOKERS. CURRENT SMOKERS EXPERIENCE THE HIGHEST DEATH RATES, WHILE EX-SMOKERS SHOW LOWER RATES, ESPECIALLY AFTER QUITTING. NON-SMOKERS HAVE THE LOWEST DEATH RATES.

### CARBON MONOXIDE IN SMOKE
CIGARETTE SMOKE CONTAINS CARBON MONOXIDE, A HARMFUL GAS THAT ENTERS THE BLOODSTREAM UPON INHALATION. IT INTERFERES WITH OXYGEN TRANSPORT BY BINDING MORE TIGHTLY TO HEMOGLOBIN THAN OXYGEN, FORMING CARBOXYHAEMOGLOBIN. THIS REDUCES THE BLOOD'S ABILITY TO CARRY OXYGEN THROUGHOUT THE BODY.

#### HEALTH RISKS
CARBON MONOXIDE FROM SMOKING CONTRIBUTES SIGNIFICANTLY TO HEART DISEASE AND POSES PREGNANCY RISKS. SMOKING DEPRIVES THE FETUS OF OXYGEN, LEADING TO LOWER BIRTH WEIGHTS IN BABIES COMPARED TO THOSE BORN TO NON-SMOKERS.

### SOME SMOKING STATISTICS
 GLOBALLY, OVER 1 BILLION PEOPLE SMOKE, CONSUMING APPROXIMATELY 5.8 TRILLION CIGARETTES ANNUALLY. TOBACCO-RELATED DEATHS CLAIM NEARLY 6 MILLION LIVES EACH YEAR, PROJECTED TO RISE TO 8 MILLION BY 2030, WITH 80% OCCURRING IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. SMOKING ACCOUNTS FOR 80% OF LUNG CANCER DEATHS, 80% OF BRONCHITIS AND EMPHYSEMA DEATHS, AND 14% OF HEART DISEASE DEATHS. IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE THAN A QUARTER OF ALL CANCER DEATHS, INCLUDING CANCERS OF THE LUNG, MOUTH, THROAT, BLADDER, KIDNEY, PANCREAS, STOMACH, LIVER, AND CERVIX.

### TRENDS IN SMOKING
SMOKING PREVALENCE HAS DECLINED IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES LIKE THE UK, WHILE INCREASING IN DEVELOPING REGIONS. IN THE UK, 9.6 MILLION ADULTS SMOKE, WITH 20% OF MEN AND 17% OF WOMEN BEING CURRENT SMOKERS. HOWEVER, 22% OF WOMEN AND 30% OF MEN ARE EX-SMOKERS. SURVEYS INDICATE THAT ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF CURRENT SMOKERS WISH TO QUIT. GLOBALLY, 31% OF MEN AND 8% OF WOMEN SMOKE, WITH VARYING CONSUMPTION RATES ACROSS COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY INCREASING IN SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL ASIA, EASTERN EUROPE, AND AFRICA.

### CONCLUSION
THE EFFECTS OF SMOKING AND ASSOCIATED STATISTICS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC HEALTH AWARENESS. EFFORTS TO REDUCE SMOKING RATES AND EDUCATE INDIVIDUALS ON TOBACCO RISKS ARE CRUCIAL FOR IMPROVING GLOBAL HEALTH OUTCOMES.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: BREATHING AND GAS EXCHANGE

## SMOKING AND ITS IMPACT

IN CHINA ALONE, APPROXIMATELY 350 MILLION PEOPLE SMOKE, ACCOUNTING FOR ONE-THIRD OF ALL CIGARETTES CONSUMED GLOBALLY. MAJOR TOBACCO COMPANIES HAVE SOUGHT TO ENTER THE CHINESE MARKET. HOWEVER, SMOKING LEADS TO OVER A MILLION ANNUAL DEATHS FROM SMOKING-RELATED DISEASES IN CHINA, WITH THIS FIGURE EXPECTED TO DOUBLE BY 2025.

### ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES

IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, SMOKING HAS SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC IMPACTS. SMOKERS OFTEN SPEND SUBSTANTIAL INCOME ON CIGARETTES, DIVERTING RESOURCES FROM NECESSITIES LIKE FOOD, HEALTHCARE, AND EDUCATION. ADDITIONALLY, TOBACCO FARMING USES LAND THAT COULD BE ALLOCATED FOR FOOD PRODUCTION. IN 2012, 7.5 MILLION TONNES OF TOBACCO LEAF WERE CULTIVATED ACROSS NEARLY 4.3 MILLION HECTARES, AN AREA LARGER THAN SWITZERLAND.

## GIVING UP SMOKING

MANY SMOKERS DESIRE A METHOD TO QUIT, THOUGH NICOTINE'S ADDICTIVE NATURE LEADS TO WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS UPON CESSATION, INCLUDING CRAVINGS, RESTLESSNESS, AND WEIGHT GAIN DUE TO REDUCED APPETITE.

### METHODS TO QUIT SMOKING

SEVERAL METHODS AID SMOKERS IN QUITTING:

- **ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES (E-CIGARETTES)**: PROVIDE NICOTINE WITHOUT HARMFUL TAR FROM TRADITIONAL CIGARETTES.
- **NICOTINE PATCHES**: DELIVER CONTROLLED NICOTINE DOSES TO REDUCE CRAVINGS.
- **NICOTINE CHEWING GUM**: SIMILAR TO PATCHES, HELPS MANAGE CRAVINGS BY OFFERING NICOTINE.

THESE METHODS WORK BY GRADUALLY REDUCING NICOTINE INTAKE UNTIL THE HABIT IS DISCONTINUED.

### EXTENSION WORK

CONDUCT AN INTERNET SEARCH TO EXPLORE QUITTING METHODS. CONSIDER QUESTIONS LIKE THE SUCCESS RATES OF DIFFERENT METHODS AND E-CIGARETTES' SAFETY EVIDENCE. ADDITIONAL METHODS INCLUDE DRUGS REDUCING WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS, ACUPUNCTURE, AND HYPNOTISM.

## CHAPTER QUESTIONS

## UNDERSTANDING BREATHING

BREATHING IS A CRITICAL PROCESS THAT FACILITATES GAS EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE BODY AND ENVIRONMENT. IT SUPPLIES OXYGEN TO CELLS AND REMOVES CARBON DIOXIDE FROM THE BODY.

### COMPOSITION OF AIR

- **ATMOSPHERIC AIR**:
  - OXYGEN: 21%
  - NITROGEN: 78%

  - OXYGEN: 16%
  - NITROGEN: 78%
  - CARBON DIOXIDE: 4%

**QUESTION**: WHICH ROW IN THE TABLE SHOWS THE CORRECT PERCENTAGE OF OXYGEN IN ATMOSPHERIC AND EXHALED AIR?

### DISEASES RELATED TO BREATHING

CIGARETTE SMOKE CONTAINS HARMFUL CHEMICALS. ONE SUCH CONDITION IS EMPHYSEMA, WHERE ALVEOLI WALLS BREAK DOWN.

**QUESTION**: WHAT IS THE NAME GIVEN TO THIS DISEASE?
- A) BRONCHITIS
- B) EMPHYSEMA
- C) CORONARY HEART DISEASE
- D) LUNG CANCER

## VENTILATION PROCESS

DURING VENTILATION, SEVERAL ACTIONS OCCUR WITHIN THE THORAX. THESE INCLUDE:

- EXTERNAL INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES CONTRACTING DURING EXHALATION.
- INTERNAL INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES RELAXING DURING INHALATION.
- RIBS MOVING DOWNWARD AND INWARD DURING EXHALATION.
- DIAPHRAGM DESCENDING DURING INHALATION.
- THORACIC VOLUME INCREASING DURING INHALATION.
- INTRAPLEURAL PRESSURE DECREASING DURING INHALATION.
- LUNG VOLUME INCREASING DURING INHALATION.

### STUDENT'S DESCRIPTION OF LUNG FUNCTION

THE STUDENT'S DESCRIPTION CAN BE REFINED TO BETTER REFLECT LUNG FUNCTION:

"WHEN AIR IS INHALED, THE LUNGS EXPAND, CAUSING THE DIAPHRAGM TO LOWER AND RIBS TO RISE. OXYGEN ENTERS ALVEOLI WHERE RED BLOOD CELLS ABSORB IT. OXYGENATED BLOOD CIRCULATES THROUGH THE BODY, DELIVERING OXYGEN TO CELLS. DEOXYGENATED BLOOD RETURNS TO ALVEOLI FOR CARBON DIOXIDE ELIMINATION. EXHALATION EXPELS STALE AIR FROM LUNGS."

### PNEUMOTHORAX

A PNEUMOTHORAX OCCURS WHEN A CHEST INJURY ALLOWS AIR INTO THE PLEURAL SPACE, CAUSING LUNG COLLAPSE ON THE AFFECTED SIDE.

**CASE STUDY**: A PATIENT WITH A LEFT-SIDED PNEUMOTHORAX HAD HIS LEFT LUNG COLLAPSED BUT CONTINUED TO BREATHE NORMALLY USING HIS RIGHT LUNG.

**QUESTIONS**:
1. WHY DID THE LEFT LUNG COLLAPSE?
2. WHY WAS THE RIGHT LUNG UNAFFECTED?

AN ARTIFICIAL PNEUMOTHORAX INVOLVES CREATING A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT FOR AN INJURED OR INFECTED LUNG, POTENTIALLY INVOLVING MECHANICAL ASSISTANCE OR REDUCED PRESSURE TO AID RECOVERY.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: BREATHING AND GAS EXCHANGE

## IMPORTANCE OF KEY FEATURES IN BREATHING

THE TRACHEA WALL CONSISTS OF C-SHAPED RINGS OF CARTILAGE THAT PROVIDE STRUCTURAL SUPPORT, PREVENTING COLLAPSE DURING INHALATION AND EXHALATION. THE MINIMAL DISTANCE BETWEEN THE AIR IN AN ALVEOLUS AND THE BLOOD IN AN ALVEOLAR CAPILLARY IS LESS THAN 1/10,000TH OF A MILLIMETER, FACILITATING EFFICIENT GAS EXCHANGE. OXYGEN ENTERS THE BLOODSTREAM, WHILE CARBON DIOXIDE IS EXPELLED. THE TRACHEA'S LINING INCLUDES MUCUS-SECRETING CELLS AND CILIA, WHICH TRAP DUST AND PATHOGENS, PREVENTING AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION BY MOVING MUCUS UPWARDS TOWARDS THE THROAT. SMOKING REDUCES BLOOD OXYGEN CONCENTRATION DUE TO LUNG FUNCTION IMPAIRMENT. NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY CAN AID SMOKING CESSATION BY REDUCING WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS.

THE LUNGS' SURFACE AREA IS APPROXIMATELY 60 M², AND THEIR RICH BLOOD SUPPLY ENHANCES GAS EXCHANGE EFFICIENCY.

## LUNG DISEASES: BRONCHITIS VS. EMPHYSEMA

BRONCHITIS INVOLVES INFLAMMATION OF THE BRONCHIAL TUBES, LEADING TO COUGHING AND MUCUS PRODUCTION. IT CAN BE ACUTE OR CHRONIC, OFTEN CAUSED BY SMOKING OR INFECTIONS. EMPHYSEMA IS A PROGRESSIVE DISEASE DESTROYING ALVEOLI, REDUCING GAS EXCHANGE SURFACE AREA. IT CAUSES BREATHING DIFFICULTY AND IS PRIMARILY LINKED TO LONG-TERM SMOKING.

## SMOKING AND LUNG CANCER: A STUDY

A 1950S STUDY EXAMINED LUNG CANCER AMONG MALE DOCTORS AGED 35 OR OVER, MONITORING SMOKING HABITS AND TRACKING DEATHS. RESULTS SHOWED A CLEAR CORRELATION BETWEEN CIGARETTE CONSUMPTION AND LUNG CANCER INCIDENCE, WITH HIGHER RATES ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER MORTALITY.

### GRAPH ANALYSIS

THE GRAPH CATEGORIZES DOCTORS BY SMOKING LEVELS: 25+ CIGARETTES PER DAY, 15-24, 1-14, AND NON-SMOKERS. DATA SUGGESTS HIGHER SMOKING CORRELATES WITH INCREASED LUNG CANCER DEATHS.

## EXPECTED DEATHS FROM LUNG CANCER

EXPECTED LUNG CANCER DEATHS FOR MEN AGED 55 WHO SMOKED 25 CIGARETTES DAILY CAN BE ESTIMATED USING STATISTICAL DATA. COMPARISONS WITH THOSE SMOKING 10 CIGARETTES PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO SMOKING IMPACT.

## EVALUATING EVIDENCE

COMPARING THE DOCTORS' STUDY WITH ANOTHER (TABLE 3.2), CONSIDER FACTORS LIKE SAMPLE SIZE AND METHODOLOGY TO ASSESS EVIDENCE STRENGTH. CONSISTENCY OF RESULTS IS CRUCIAL FOR CONVINCING POWER.

## CREATIVE PROJECT: SMOKING AND LUNG CANCER LEAFLET

DESIGN A COMPELLING LEAFLET USING COMPUTER SOFTWARE, FOCUSING ON IMPACTFUL SMOKING STATISTICS WITHOUT EXCESSIVE DETAIL. HIGHLIGHT SERIOUS HEALTH RISKS, ESPECIALLY LUNG CANCER, TO ENCOURAGE ADULT SMOKERS TO QUIT.
