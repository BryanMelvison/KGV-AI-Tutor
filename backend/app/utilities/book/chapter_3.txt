# 3 BREATHING AND GAS EXCHANGE

When we breathe, air is moved in and out of the lungs so that gas exchange can take place between the air and the blood. This chapter looks at these processes, and also deals with some ways that smoking can damage the lungs and stop these vital organs from working properly.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

- Describe the structure of the thorax, including the ribs, intercostal muscles, diaphragm, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli and pleural membranes
- Understand the role of the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm in ventilation
- Explain how alveoli are adapted for gas exchange by diffusion between air in the lungs and blood in capillaries
- Investigate breathing in humans, including the release of carbon dioxide and the effect of exercise
- Understand the biological consequences of smoking in relation to the lungs and circulatory system, including coronary heart disease.

Cells get their energy by oxidising foods such as glucose, during the process called respiration. If cells are to respire aerobically, they need a continuous supply of oxygen from the blood. In addition, carbon dioxide from respiration needs to be removed from the body. In humans, these gases are exchanged between the blood and the air in the lungs.

## RESPIRATION AND BREATHING

You need to understand the difference between respiration and breathing. Respiration is the oxidation reaction that releases energy from foods such as glucose (Chapter 1). Breathing is the mechanism that moves air into and out of the lungs, allowing gas exchange to take place. The lungs and associated structures are often called the 'respiratory system' but this can be confusing. It is better to call them the gas exchange system and this is the term we use in this book.

## THE STRUCTURE OF THE GAS EXCHANGE SYSTEM

The lungs are enclosed in the chest or thorax by the ribcage and a muscular sheet of tissue called the diaphragm (Figure 3.1). As you will see, the actions of these two structures bring about the movements of air into and out of the lungs. Joining each rib to the next are two sets of muscles called intercostal muscles ('costals' are rib bones). The diaphragm separates the contents of the thorax from the abdomen. It is not flat, but a shallow dome shape, with a fibrous middle part forming the 'roof' of the dome, and muscular edges forming the walls.

The air passages of the lungs form a highly branching network (Figure 3.2). This is why it is sometimes called the bronchial tree.

When we breathe in, air enters our nose or mouth and passes down the windpipe or trachea. The trachea splits into two tubes called the bronchi (singular bronchus), one leading to each lung. Each bronchus divides into smaller and smaller tubes called bronchioles, eventually ending at microscopic air sacs, called alveoli (singular alveolus). It is here that gas exchange with the blood takes place.

The walls of trachea and bronchi contain rings of gristle or cartilage. These support the airways and keep them open when we breathe in. They are rather like the rings in a vacuum cleaner hose – without them the hose would squash flat when the cleaner sucks air in.

The inside of the thorax is separated from the lungs by two thin, moist membranes called the pleural membranes. They make up a continuous envelope around the lungs, forming an airtight seal. Between the two membranes is a space called the pleural cavity, filled with a thin layer of liquid called pleural fluid. This acts as lubrication, so that the surfaces of the lungs don't stick to the inside of the chest wall when we breathe.

### EXTENSION WORK

In the bronchi, the cartilage forms complete, circular rings. In the trachea, the rings are incomplete, and shaped like a letter 'C'. The open part of the ring is at the back of the trachea, next to where the oesophagus (gullet) lies as it passes through the thorax. When food passes along the oesophagus by peristalsis (see Chapter 4) the gaps in the rings allow the lumps of food to pass through more easily, without the peristaltic wave 'catching' on the rings (Figure 3.3).

### KEEPING THE AIRWAYS CLEAN

The trachea and larger airways are lined with a layer of cells that have an important role in keeping the airways clean. Some cells in this lining secrete a sticky liquid called mucus, which traps particles of dirt or bacteria that are breathed in. Other cells are covered with tiny hair-like structures called cilia (Figure 3.4). The cilia beat backward and forward, sweeping the mucus and trapped particles out towards the mouth. In this way, dirt and bacteria are

## Figure 3.6 Changes in the position of the ribs and diaphragm during breathing

### (a) Inhalation
- Air enters lungs through trachea
- Cavity containing pleural fluid expands
- Ribs move outward
- Lung expands
- Lower pressure than outside body
- Diaphragm muscles contract, diaphragm flattens
- External intercostal muscles contract, pulling ribs up and out

### (b) Exhalation
- Air pushed out of lungs
- Ribs move inward
- Lung contracts
- Higher pressure than outside body
- Diaphragm muscles relax, diaphragm becomes dome-shaped
- Internal intercostal muscles contract, pulling ribs down and in

## KEY POINT

It is important that you remember the changes in volume and pressure during ventilation. If you have trouble understanding these, think of what happens when you use a bicycle pump. If you push the pump handle, the air in the pump is squashed, its pressure rises and it is forced out of the pump. If you pull on the handle, the air pressure inside the pump falls a little, and air is drawn in from outside. This is similar to what happens in the lungs. In exams, students sometimes talk about the lungs forcing the air in and out – they don't!

## GAS EXCHANGE IN THE ALVEOLI

You can tell what is happening during gas exchange if you compare the amounts of different gases in atmospheric air with the air breathed out (Table 3.1).

### Table 3.1 Approximate percentage volume of gases in atmospheric (inhaled) and exhaled air

| Gas | Atmospheric air / % | Exhaled air / % |
|-----|---------------------|-----------------|
| nitrogen | 78 | 79 |
| oxygen | 21 | 16 |
| carbon dioxide | 0.04 | 4 |
| other gases (mainly argon) | 1 | 1 |

### HINT

Be careful when interpreting percentages! The percentage of a gas in a mixture can vary, even if the actual amount of the gas stays the same. This is easiest to understand from an example. Imagine you have a bottle containing a mixture of 20% oxygen and 80% nitrogen. If you used a chemical to absorb all the oxygen in the bottle, the nitrogen left would now be 100% of the gas in the bottle, despite the fact that the amount of nitrogen would still be the same. That is why the percentage of nitrogen in inhaled and exhaled air is slightly different.

Exhaled air is also warmer than atmospheric air, and is saturated with water vapour. The amount of water vapour in the atmosphere varies depending on weather conditions.

Clearly, the lungs are absorbing oxygen into the blood and removing carbon dioxide from it. This happens in the alveoli. To do this efficiently, the alveoli must have a structure which brings the air and blood very close together, over a very large surface area. There are enormous numbers of alveoli. It has been calculated that the two lungs contain about 700,000,000 of these tiny air sacs, giving a total surface area of 60 m². That's bigger than the floor area of an average classroom! Viewed through a high-powered microscope, the alveoli look rather like bunches of grapes, and are covered with tiny blood capillaries (Figure 3.7).

| blood back to heart      | wall of capillary                   |
| one alveolus             | deoxygenated blood                  |
| blood from heart         | oxygen                              |
|                          | carbon dioxide                      |
| thin layer of            | cells of alveolus wall              |
| fluid lining alveolus    | red blood cells                     |

### HINT

Be careful - students sometimes write 'The alveolus has cell walls'. This statement is not correct - a cell wall is part of a plant cell! The correct way to describe the structure is: 'The alveolus has a wall made of cells'.

Deoxygenated blood is pumped from the heart to the lungs and passes through the capillaries surrounding the alveoli. The blood has come from the respiring tissues of the body, where it has given up some of its oxygen to the cells, and gained carbon dioxide. Around the lungs, the blood is separated from the air inside each alveolus by only two cell layers; the cells making up the wall of the alveolus, and the capillary wall itself. This is a distance of less than a thousandth of a millimetre.

### EXTENSION WORK

The thin layer of fluid lining the inside of the alveoli comes from the blood. The capillaries and cells of the alveolar wall are 'leaky' and the blood pressure pushes fluid out from the blood plasma into the alveolus. Oxygen dissolves in this moist surface before it passes through the alveolar wall into the blood.

Because the air in the alveolus has a higher concentration of oxygen than the blood entering the capillary network, oxygen diffuses from the air, across the wall of the alveolus and into the blood. At the same time there is more carbon dioxide in the blood than there is in the air in the lungs. This means that there is a diffusion gradient for carbon dioxide in the other direction, so carbon dioxide diffuses the other way, out of the blood and into the alveolus. The result is that the blood which leaves the capillaries and flows back to the heart has gained oxygen and lost carbon dioxide. The heart then pumps the oxygenated blood around the body again, to supply the respiring cells (see Chapter 5).

Describe the difference in the breathing rates of the two girls (A and B) after exercise. Which girl is more fit? Explain your reasoning.

## THE EFFECTS OF SMOKING

In order for the lungs to exchange gases properly, the air passages need to be clear, the alveoli need to be free from dirt particles and bacteria, and they must have as big a surface area as possible in contact with the blood. There is one habit that can upset all of these conditions – smoking.

Links between smoking and diseases of the lungs are now a proven fact. Smoking is associated with lung cancer, bronchitis and emphysema. It is also a major contributing factor to other conditions, such as coronary heart disease and ulcers of the stomach and intestine. Pregnant women who smoke are more likely to give birth to underweight babies.

Coronary heart disease will be described in Chapter 5 after you have studied the structure of the heart. Here we will look at a number of other medical conditions that are caused by smoking.

### EFFECTS OF SMOKE ON THE LINING OF THE AIR PASSAGES

You saw above how the lungs are kept free of particles of dirt and bacteria by the action of mucus and cilia. In the trachea and bronchi of a smoker, the cilia are destroyed by the chemicals in cigarette smoke.
---
The reduced numbers of cilia mean that the mucus is not swept away from the lungs, but remains to block the air passages. This is made worse by the fact that the smoke irritates the lining of the airways, stimulating the cells to secrete more mucus. The sticky mucus blocking the airways is the source of 'smoker's cough'. Irritation of the bronchial tree, along with infections from bacteria in the mucus, can cause the lung disease bronchitis. Bronchitis blocks normal air flow, so the sufferer has difficulty breathing properly.

## EMPHYSEMA

Emphysema is another lung disease that kills about 20000 people in Britain every year. Smoking is the cause of one type of emphysema. Smoke damages the walls of the alveoli, which break down and fuse together again, forming enlarged, irregular air spaces (Figure 3.9).

This greatly reduces the surface area for gas exchange, which becomes very inefficient. The blood of a person with emphysema carries less oxygen. In serious cases, this leads to the sufferer being unable to carry out even mild exercise, such as walking. Emphysema patients often have to have a supply of oxygen nearby at all times (Figure 3.10). There is no cure for emphysema, and usually the sufferer dies after a long and distressing illness.

[Image description: Two diagrams showing alveoli in a normal lung and alveoli in the lung of a person suffering from emphysema. The normal lung shows many small, round alveoli, while the emphysema lung shows fewer, larger, and irregularly shaped air spaces.]

### EXTENSION WORK

A person who has chronic (long-term) bronchitis and emphysema is said to be suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. COPD is a progressive disease for which there is no cure.

Figure 3.9 The alveoli of a person suffering from emphysema have a greatly reduced surface area and inefficient gas exchange.

Figure 3.10 Patients with emphysema often need to breathe air enriched with oxygen in order to stay alive.

## LUNG CANCER

Evidence of the link between smoking and lung cancer first appeared in the 1950s. In one study, a number of patients in hospital were given a series of questions about their lifestyles. They were asked about their work, hobbies, housing and so on, including a question about how many cigarettes they smoked. The same questionnaire was given to two groups of patients. The first group were all suffering from lung cancer. The second (Control) group were in hospital with various other illnesses, but not lung cancer. To make it a fair comparison, the Control patients were matched with the lung cancer patients for sex, age and so on.

When the results were compared, one difference stood out (Table 3.2). A greater proportion of the lung cancer patients were smokers than in the Control patients. There seemed to be a connection between smoking and getting lung cancer.

                                                statistically significant link between smoking and the disease: this is called a
                                               'correlation'.
                                               Over 20 similar investigations in nine countries have revealed the same
                                               findings. In 1962 a report called 'Smoking and health' was published by the

                                               dangers of smoking: Not surprisingly, the first people to take the findings
                                               seriously were doctors, many of whom stopped smoking: This was reflected
                                               in their death rates from lung cancer: In ten years; while deaths among the
                                               general male population had risen by '% , the deaths of male doctors from the
                                               disease had fallen by 38%_

                                               formaldehyde; cyanide; benzene; and toluene More than 60 of the chemicals
                                               are known to cause cancer: These chemicals are called carcinogens, and are
                                               contained in the tar that collects in a smoker's lungs. Cancer happens when cells
                                               mutate and start to divide uncontrollably, forming a tumour (Figure 3.11). If a

                                               before the cancer cells spread to other tissues of the body: Unfortunately
                                               tumours in the lungs usually cause no pain, sOtheyare not discovered until it is

### CARBON MONOXIDE IN SMOKE

One of the harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke is the poisonous gas carbon monoxide. When this gas is breathed in with the smoke, it enters the bloodstream and interferes with the ability of the blood to carry oxygen. Oxygen is carried around in the blood in the red blood cells, attached to a chemical called haemoglobin (see Chapter 5). Carbon monoxide can combine with the haemoglobin much more tightly than oxygen can, forming a compound called carboxyhaemoglobin. The haemoglobin will combine with carbon monoxide in preference to oxygen. When this happens, the blood carries much less oxygen around the body. Carbon monoxide from smoking is also a major cause of heart disease (Chapter 5).

If a pregnant woman smokes, she will be depriving her unborn fetus of oxygen (Figure 3.14). This has an effect on its growth and development, and leads to the mass of the baby at birth being lower, on average, than the mass of babies born to non-smokers.

### SOME SMOKING STATISTICS

- It is estimated that there are over 1 billion smokers worldwide. In 2014 they consumed 5.8 trillion cigarettes.
- Every year nearly 6 million people are killed by tobacco-related illnesses. If the current trend continues, by 2030 this will rise to 8 million deaths per year and 80% of these premature deaths will be in developing countries.
- Smoking causes almost 80% of deaths from lung cancer, 80% of deaths from bronchitis and emphysema, and 14% of deaths from heart disease.
- More than a quarter of all cancer deaths are attributable to smoking. These include cancer of the lung, mouth, lip, throat, bladder, kidney, pancreas, stomach, liver and cervix.
- While demand for tobacco has steadily fallen in developed countries like the UK, cigarette consumption is being increasingly concentrated in the developing world.
- 9.6 million adults in the UK smoke cigarettes, 20% of men and 17% of women. However, 22% of women and 30% of men in the UK are now ex-smokers. Surveys show that about two-thirds of current smokers would like to stop smoking.
- It is estimated that worldwide, 31% of men and 8% of women are smokers. Consumption varies widely between different countries, but generally the areas of the world where there has been no change in consumption, or an increase, are southern and central Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa.

- In China alone there are about 350 million smokers, who consume about one-third of all cigarettes smoked worldwide. Large multinational tobacco companies have long been keen to enter the Chinese market.
- In China there are over a million deaths a year from smoking-related diseases. This figure is expected to double by 2025.
- In developing countries, smoking has a greater economic impact. Poorer smokers spend significant amounts of their income on cigarettes rather than necessities like food, healthcare and education.
- Tobacco farming uses up land that could be used for growing food crops. In 2012, 7.5 million tonnes of tobacco leaf were grown on almost 4.3 million hectares of land (an area larger than Switzerland).

## GIVING UP SMOKING

Most smokers admit that they would like to find a way to give up the habit. The trouble is that the nicotine in tobacco is a very addictive drug, and causes withdrawal symptoms when people stop smoking. These include cravings for a cigarette, restlessness and a tendency to put on weight (nicotine depresses the appetite).

There are various ways that smokers can be helped to give up their habit. One method is 'vaping', which involves inhaling a vapour containing nicotine from an electronic cigarette or e-cigarette (Figure 3.15). Other methods use nicotine patches (Figure 3.16) or nicotine chewing gum. They all work in a similar way, providing the smoker with a source of nicotine without the harmful tar from cigarettes. The nicotine is absorbed by the body and reduces the craving for a cigarette. Gradually, the patient reduces the nicotine dose until they are weaned off the habit.

### EXTENSION WORK

You could carry out an Internet search to find out about the different methods people use to help them give up smoking. Which methods have the highest success rate? Is there any evidence that suggests e-cigarettes are not safe?

There are several other ways that people use to help them give up smoking, including the use of drugs that reduce withdrawal symptoms, acupuncture and even hypnotism.

| internal intercostal muscles | | |
| ribs | | move down and in |
| diaphragm | | |
| volume of thorax | | |
| pressure in thorax | | |
| volume of air in lungs | | |

6. A student wrote the following about the lungs.
When we breathe in, our lungs inflate, sucking air in and pushing the ribs up and out, and forcing the diaphragm down. This is called respiration. In the air sacs of the lungs, the air enters the blood. The blood then takes the air around the body, where it is used by the cells. The blood returns to the lungs to be cleaned. When we breathe out, our lungs deflate, pulling the diaphragm up and the ribs down. The stale air is pushed out of the lungs.
The student did not have a good understanding of the workings of the lungs. Re-write their description, using correct biological words and ideas.

7. Sometimes, people injured in an accident such as a car crash suffer from a pneumothorax. This is an injury where the chest wall is punctured, allowing air to enter the pleural cavity (see Figure 3.1). A patient was brought to the casualty department of a hospital, suffering from a pneumothorax on the left side of his chest. His left lung had collapsed, but he was able to breathe normally with his right lung.
a Explain why a pneumothorax caused the left lung to collapse.
b Explain why the right lung was not affected.
c If a patient's lung is injured or infected, a surgeon can sometimes 'rest' it by performing an operation called an artificial pneumothorax. What do you think might be involved in this operation?

## SKILLS ANALYSIS

10. A long-term investigation was carried out into the link between smoking and lung cancer. The smoking habits of male doctors aged 35 or over were determined while they were still alive, then the number and causes of deaths among them were monitored over a number of years. (Note that this survey was carried out in the 1950s - very few doctors smoke these days!) The results are shown in the graph.

| Age/years | 25+ per day | 15-24 per day | 1-14 per day | non smokers |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| 0-35-44   | 0.1         | 0.1            | 0.1          | 0           |

c. Table 3.2 (page 43) shows the findings of another study linking lung cancer with smoking. Which do you think is the more convincing evidence of the link, this investigation or the findings illustrated in Table 3.2?

## SKILLS CREATIVITY

11. Design and make a hard-hitting leaflet explaining the link between smoking and lung cancer. It should be aimed at encouraging an adult smoker to give up the habit. You could use suitable computer software to produce your design. Include some smoking statistics, perhaps from an Internet search. However don't use too many, or they may put the person off reading the leaflet!
