# CHAPTER 18: GENES AND INHERITANCE

## INTRODUCTION
HOW AND WHY DO WE INHERIT FEATURES FROM OUR PARENTS? THIS CHAPTER EXPLORES THE WORK OF GREGOR MENDEL, WHO UNRAVELED THE MYSTERIES OF INHERITANCE.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES
BY THE END OF THIS CHAPTER, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO:
- UNDERSTAND THAT GENES EXIST IN ALTERNATIVE FORMS CALLED ALLELES.
- INTERPRET FAMILY PEDIGREES.
- RECOGNIZE HOW SEX IS CONTROLLED BY CHROMOSOMES (XX IN FEMALES AND XY IN MALES).
- DESCRIBE OFFSPRING'S SEX DETERMINATION AT FERTILIZATION USING GENETIC DIAGRAMS.
- DEFINE TERMS LIKE DOMINANT, RECESSIVE, HOMOZYGOUS, HETEROZYGOUS, PHENOTYPE, GENOTYPE, AND MONOHYBRID INHERITANCE PATTERNS.
- PREDICT OUTCOMES FROM MONOHYBRID CROSSES.
- RECOGNIZE THAT MOST PHENOTYPIC FEATURES RESULT FROM POLYGENIC INHERITANCE.

## GREGOR MENDEL: THE FATHER OF GENETICS
GREGOR MENDEL WAS A MONK IN BRNO, CZECH REPUBLIC, WHO STUDIED HEREDITY THROUGH PEA PLANT BREEDING EXPERIMENTS.

### MENDEL'S DISCOVERIES
MENDEL IDENTIFIED KEY PRINCIPLES:
- A HERITABLE UNIT (GENE) PASSES FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION.
- GENES CAN EXIST IN ALTERNATIVE FORMS (ALLELES).
- EACH INDIVIDUAL HAS TWO ALLELES PER FEATURE.
- GAMETES CONTAIN ONE ALLELE PER FEATURE.
- ONE ALLELE MAY DOMINATE OVER ANOTHER.

MENDEL USED THESE IDEAS TO PREDICT CROSS-BREEDING OUTCOMES, PUBLISHING HIS FINDINGS IN 1865. HIS WORK WAS LATER REDISCOVERED IN 1900, LEADING TO THE CONNECTION BETWEEN GENES AND CHROMOSOMES, FOUNDING GENETICS AS A FIELD.

## REDISCOVERY OF MENDEL'S WORK
IN 1903, SCIENTISTS REALIZED MENDEL'S WORK LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING INHERITANCE THROUGH GENES AND CHROMOSOMES, ESTABLISHING GENETICS AS A SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINE.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION: MENDEL'S EXPERIMENTS ON INHERITANCE

## KEY POINT
MENDEL INITIALLY USED ONLY PLANTS THAT HAD "BRED TRUE" FOR SEVERAL GENERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, ANY TALL PEA PLANTS HE USED CAME FROM GENERATIONS OF PEA PLANTS THAT WERE ALL TALL.

## GENES AND INHERITANCE
MENDEL OBSERVED THAT MANY FEATURES OF PEA PLANTS HAD TWO DISTINCT FORMS. THESE INCLUDED TRAITS SUCH AS HEIGHT (TALL OR DWARF), FLOWER COLOR (PURPLE OR WHITE), AND SEED COLOR (YELLOW OR GREEN). NOTABLY, THERE WERE NO INTERMEDIATE FORMS; EACH TRAIT WAS DISTINCTLY EXPRESSED IN TWO CONTRASTING FORMS.

## CONTRASTING FEATURES OF PEA PLANTS
MENDEL USED SEVERAL CONTRASTING FEATURES IN HIS BREEDING EXPERIMENTS. THESE INCLUDED:
- SEED SHAPE: ROUND VS. WRINKLED
- SEED COLOR: YELLOW VS. GREEN
- FLOWER COLOR: PURPLE VS. WHITE
- POD SHAPE: INFLATED VS. CONSTRICTED
- POD COLOR: GREEN VS. YELLOW
- STEM LENGTH: TALL VS. DWARF

## METHODOLOGY
MENDEL SYSTEMATICALLY INVESTIGATED THE RESULTS OF CROSS-BREEDING BY TRANSFERRING POLLEN FROM ONE EXPERIMENTAL PLANT TO ANOTHER, ENSURING THAT THE PLANTS COULD NOT SELF-FERTILIZE. HE COLLECTED ALL THE SEEDS FORMED, GREW THEM, AND NOTED THE FEATURES THAT EACH PLANT DEVELOPED.

THE FIRST GENERATION OF OFFSPRING FROM THESE EXPERIMENTS IS REFERRED TO AS THE F1 GENERATION. MENDEL DID NOT CROSS-POLLINATE THESE F1 PLANTS; INSTEAD, HE ALLOWED THEM TO SELF-FERTILIZE. HE THEN COLLECTED THE SEEDS FROM THIS GENERATION, GREW THEM, AND NOTED THE FEATURES OF THE RESULTING PLANTS, WHICH FORMED THE SECOND GENERATION OF OFFSPRING, KNOWN AS THE F2 GENERATION.

WHEN MENDEL USED PURE-BREEDING TALL AND PURE-BREEDING DWARF PLANTS AS HIS PARENTS, HE OBTAINED SPECIFIC RESULTS THAT ILLUSTRATED THE PRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE.

THROUGH THESE EXPERIMENTS, MENDEL LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR THE FIELD OF GENETICS, DEMONSTRATING HOW TRAITS ARE INHERITED FROM ONE GENERATION TO THE NEXT. HIS WORK SHOWED HOW VARIATION AND SELECTION PLAY ROLES IN THE INHERITANCE OF TRAITS.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION: GENES AND INHERITANCE

## MENDEL'S EXPERIMENTS WITH PEA PLANTS

IN THE 19TH CENTURY, GREGOR MENDEL CONDUCTED GROUNDBREAKING EXPERIMENTS WITH PEA PLANTS THAT LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF GENETICS. HIS WORK REVEALED IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE.

### KEY OBSERVATIONS FROM MENDEL'S BREEDING EXPERIMENTS

1. **UNIFORMITY IN THE F1 GENERATION**:
   WHEN MENDEL CROSSED A TALL PARENT PLANT WITH A DWARF PARENT PLANT, ALL OFFSPRING (F1 GENERATION) WERE TALL, INDICATING THAT THE TALL TRAIT WAS DOMINANT OVER THE DWARF TRAIT.

2. **SEGREGATION IN THE F2 GENERATION**:
   SELF-POLLINATING THE TALL F1 PLANTS RESULTED IN A 3:1 RATIO IN THE F2 GENERATION, WITH THREE-QUARTERS DISPLAYING THE DOMINANT TRAIT AND ONE-QUARTER SHOWING THE RECESSIVE TRAIT.

### SUMMARY OF MENDEL'S RESULTS

- **F1 GENERATION**: ALL PLANTS EXHIBITED THE DOMINANT TRAIT (TALL).
- **F2 GENERATION**: A CONSISTENT 3:1 RATIO WAS OBSERVED, WITH THREE-QUARTERS DISPLAYING THE DOMINANT TRAIT AND ONE-QUARTER SHOWING THE RECESSIVE TRAIT.

### CONCLUSION

MENDEL'S FINDINGS DEMONSTRATED PREDICTABLE INHERITANCE PATTERNS, EVEN WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE OF CHROMOSOMES, GENES, OR MEIOSIS. HIS WORK REMAINS A CORNERSTONE OF GENETICS, INFLUENCING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HEREDITY AND VARIATION IN LIVING ORGANISMS.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION: EXPLAINING MENDEL'S RESULTS

## GENES AND INHERITANCE

EACH FEATURE IN AN ORGANISM IS CONTROLLED BY A GENE LOCATED ON A CHROMOSOME. IN BODY CELLS, THERE ARE TWO COPIES OF EACH CHROMOSOME AND GENE, EXCEPT IN GAMETES (SEX CELLS), WHICH CONTAIN ONLY ONE COPY OF EACH CHROMOSOME AND GENE (ONE ALLELE).

### KEY CONCEPTS:
- **ALLELES**: THERE ARE TWO ALLELES FOR EACH GENE: ONE DOMINANT AND ONE RECESSIVE.
- **DOMINANCE**: WHEN BOTH ALLELES ARE PRESENT IN A CELL, ONLY THE DOMINANT ALLELE IS EXPRESSED IN THE ORGANISM'S APPEARANCE (PHENOTYPE).
- **GENOTYPE VS. PHENOTYPE**:
  - **GENOTYPE**: THE ALLELES PRESENT IN AN ORGANISM (E.G., TT, TT, OR TT).
  - **PHENOTYPE**: THE OBSERVABLE CHARACTERISTICS RESULTING FROM THE GENOTYPE (E.G., TALL OR DWARF PLANTS).

## EXAMPLE: PEA PLANTS

IN PEA PLANTS, THE GENE FOR HEIGHT HAS TWO ALLELES: TALL (T) AND DWARF (T). TALL (T) IS DOMINANT OVER DWARF (T).

### PURE BREEDING PARENTS
- THE TALL PARENT HAS THE GENOTYPE TT (HOMOZYGOUS FOR TALLNESS).
- THE DWARF PARENT HAS THE GENOTYPE TT (HOMOZYGOUS FOR DWARFNESS).

## GAMETES FORMATION
GAMETES ARE FORMED THROUGH MEIOSIS, RESULTING IN SEX CELLS THAT CARRY ONLY ONE ALLELE EACH:
- THE TALL PARENT PRODUCES GAMETES WITH THE T ALLELE.
- THE DWARF PARENT PRODUCES GAMETES WITH THE T ALLELE.

## F1 GENERATION
WHEN THE TALL AND DWARF PLANTS ARE CROSSED:
- THE F1 GENERATION CONSISTS OF ALL TT (HETEROZYGOUS) PLANTS, WHICH ARE ALL TALL DUE TO THE DOMINANCE OF THE TALL ALLELE.

## SELF-FERTILIZATION OF F1 PLANTS
WHEN F1 PLANTS SELF-FERTILIZE, THE GAMETES PRODUCED WILL BE:
- HALF CARRYING THE T ALLELE AND HALF CARRYING THE T ALLELE.

## F2 GENERATION
USING A PUNNETT SQUARE TO PREDICT THE GENOTYPES OF THE F2 GENERATION:
- THE POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS FROM THE GAMETES ARE TT, TT, AND TT.
- THE RESULTING GENOTYPIC RATIO FROM THE PUNNETT SQUARE IS 1 TT : 2 TT : 1 TT.

## PHENOTYPIC RATIO
THE PHENOTYPIC RATIO OF THE F2 GENERATION IS:
- 3 TALL : 1 DWARF

THIS UNDERSTANDING OF INHERITANCE PATTERNS LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR MODERN GENETICS AND HELPS EXPLAIN THE VARIATION OBSERVED IN LIVING ORGANISMS.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION: GENES AND INHERITANCE

## KEY POINTS
IN GENETIC CROSSES, PREDICTED RATIOS LIKE 3:1 MAY NOT ALWAYS MATCH ACTUAL OFFSPRING NUMBERS DUE TO VARIOUS FACTORS AFFECTING SURVIVAL. FOR EXAMPLE, IN MENDEL'S EXPERIMENTS, HE PRODUCED 787 TALL PLANTS AND 277 DWARF PLANTS, RESULTING IN A RATIO OF APPROXIMATELY 2.84:1, WHICH IS CLOSE TO THE EXPECTED 3:1 RATIO.

## MENDEL'S EXPERIMENTS
MENDEL'S EXPERIMENTS FOCUSED ON SINGLE GENES, SUCH AS THE GENE FOR HEIGHT OR FLOWER COLOR. THIS TYPE OF INHERITANCE PATTERN IS KNOWN AS MONOHYBRID INHERITANCE. WHILE GENETIC DIAGRAMS INVOLVING MULTIPLE GENES CAN BE ANALYZED, FOR INTERNATIONAL GCSE, YOU ONLY NEED TO INTERPRET MONOHYBRID CROSSES.

### UNDERSTANDING RATIOS
THE LIKELIHOOD OF GETTING A SPECIFIC OUTCOME IN A SERIES OF INDEPENDENT EVENTS, SUCH AS FLIPPING A COIN 20 TIMES, FOLLOWS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE BELL CURVE. THE MOST PROBABLE OUTCOME IS AN EQUAL SPLIT, BUT VARIATIONS CAN OCCUR. THIS SAME PRINCIPLE APPLIES TO BREEDING EXPERIMENTS, WHERE CHANCE EVENTS CAN LEAD TO UNEXPECTED OUTCOMES.

## WORKING OUT GENOTYPES
THE GENOTYPE OF A TALL PEA PLANT (EITHER HOMOZYGOUS TT OR HETEROZYGOUS TT) CANNOT BE DETERMINED SOLELY BY ITS APPEARANCE SINCE BOTH GENOTYPES EXHIBIT THE DOMINANT TALL PHENOTYPE. TO IDENTIFY THE GENOTYPE, A BREEDING EXPERIMENT KNOWN AS A TEST CROSS IS CONDUCTED.

### THE TEST CROSS
A TEST CROSS INVOLVES BREEDING AN ORGANISM WITH AN UNKNOWN GENOTYPE (DISPLAYING THE DOMINANT PHENOTYPE) WITH ONE THAT SHOWS THE RECESSIVE PHENOTYPE. FOR EXAMPLE, A TALL PEA PLANT COULD HAVE THE GENOTYPE TT OR TT. TO DETERMINE THIS, IT IS BRED WITH A DWARF PEA PLANT (GENOTYPE TT).

#### TEST CROSS PROCEDURE
1. **GENOTYPES OF PARENTS**:
   - UNKNOWN TALL PLANT: TT OR TT
   - DWARF PLANT: TT

2. **GAMETES**:
   - THE TALL PLANT CAN PRODUCE GAMETES: T OR T
   - THE DWARF PLANT PRODUCES ONLY T GAMETES.

3. **GENOTYPES OF F1 OFFSPRING**:
   - IF THE TALL PARENT IS TT: ALL OFFSPRING WILL BE TT (TALL).
   - IF THE TALL PARENT IS TT: OFFSPRING WILL BE 50% TT (TALL) AND 50% TT (DWARF).

4. **PHENOTYPES OF F1**:
   - ALL OFFSPRING WILL BE TALL IF THE TALL PARENT IS HOMOZYGOUS (TT).
   - HALF OF THE OFFSPRING WILL BE TALL, AND HALF WILL BE DWARF IF THE TALL PARENT IS HETEROZYGOUS (TT).

### CONCLUSION
BY COMPARING THE RESULTS OF THE BREEDING EXPERIMENT WITH THE PREDICTED OUTCOMES, YOU CAN DETERMINE THE GENOTYPE OF THE UNKNOWN TALL PLANT. THIS METHOD HELPS IN UNDERSTANDING INHERITANCE PATTERNS AND THE GENETIC MAKEUP OF ORGANISMS.

# GENES AND INHERITANCE

## WAYS OF PRESENTING GENETIC INFORMATION

UNDERSTANDING GENETIC INHERITANCE OFTEN INVOLVES VISUAL METHODS SUCH AS GENETIC CROSSES AND FAMILY TREES KNOWN AS PEDIGREES. THESE TOOLS PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO HOW TRAITS ARE PASSED FROM ONE GENERATION TO THE NEXT.

### EXAMPLE: POLYDACTYLY

POLYDACTYLY IS A CONDITION WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL HAS AN EXTRA DIGIT, TYPICALLY ON THE HANDS OR FEET. THIS TRAIT IS CONTROLLED BY A DOMINANT ALLELE (D) AND A RECESSIVE ALLELE (D). THE PRESENCE OF AT LEAST ONE DOMINANT ALLELE RESULTS IN POLYDACTYLY, WHILE THE RECESSIVE ALLELE (DD) LEADS TO THE NORMAL NUMBER OF DIGITS.

- **GENOTYPES AND PHENOTYPES**:
  - **DD**: EXHIBITS POLYDACTYLY.
  - **DD**: ALSO EXHIBITS POLYDACTYLY DUE TO THE DOMINANT ALLELE.
  - **DD**: SHOWS NO EXTRA DIGITS, INDICATING THE RECESSIVE TRAIT.

### PEDIGREE ANALYSIS

A PEDIGREE DIAGRAM ILLUSTRATES A FAMILY'S GENETIC HISTORY. IN FIGURE 18.6, FOUR GENERATIONS ARE SHOWN:

- INDIVIDUALS 1 AND 2 (PARENTS) HAVE POLYDACTYLY.
- THEIR CHILDREN (4, 5, 6) INCLUDE BOTH AFFECTED AND UNAFFECTED CASES.
- INDIVIDUALS 3 AND 7 ARE UNRELATED TO THE MAIN FAMILY TREE.
- THE CONNECTION BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS 3 AND 4 INDICATES THEY SHARE THE SAME OFFSPRING AS INDIVIDUALS 1 AND 2.

FROM THIS ANALYSIS, IT IS OBSERVED THAT BOTH PARENTS HAVE THE TRAIT, WHILE SOME CHILDREN DO NOT. THIS PATTERN SUGGESTS THAT THE DOMINANT ALLELE (D) IS PRESENT AND DETERMINES THE TRAIT EXPRESSION.

### DETERMINING DOMINANCE

THE DOMINANCE OF THE POLYDACTYLY ALLELE IS EVIDENT FROM THE PEDIGREE DATA. SINCE BOTH PARENTS WITH THE TRAIT PRODUCED AFFECTED AND UNAFFECTED OFFSPRING, THE PRESENCE OF AT LEAST ONE DOMINANT ALLELE (D) LEADS TO THE PHENOTYPE. THIS OBSERVATION SUPPORTS THE CONCLUSION THAT D IS DOMINANT OVER D.

BY EXAMINING SUCH PEDIGREES, GENETICISTS CAN DEDUCE INHERITANCE PATTERNS AND PREDICT TRAIT TRANSMISSION PROBABILITIES ACROSS GENERATIONS.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION: GENES AND INHERITANCE

## UNDERSTANDING POLYDACTYLY

POLYDACTYLY IS A GENETIC CONDITION CHARACTERIZED BY THE PRESENCE OF EXTRA FINGERS OR TOES. THIS SECTION EXAMINES THE INHERITANCE PATTERNS OF POLYDACTYLY THROUGH PEDIGREE ANALYSIS.

### DOMINANT AND RECESSIVE ALLELES

IN OUR ANALYSIS, WE DETERMINED THAT THE ALLELE FOR POLYDACTYLY (D) IS DOMINANT OVER THE NORMAL ALLELE (D). CONSEQUENTLY:

- INDIVIDUALS WITH GENOTYPES **DD** OR **DD** EXHIBIT POLYDACTYLY.
- THOSE WITH GENOTYPE **DD** HAVE A NORMAL NUMBER OF DIGITS.

### ANALYZING THE PEDIGREE

THE INHERITANCE OF POLYDACTYLY CAN BE VISUALIZED THROUGH PEDIGREE CHARTS. KEY OBSERVATIONS INCLUDE:

1. **GENOTYPE IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - INDIVIDUALS WITH A NORMAL DIGIT COUNT MUST HAVE THE GENOTYPE **DD**.
   - THOSE EXHIBITING POLYDACTYLY LIKELY HAVE AT LEAST ONE DOMINANT ALLELE, MAKING THEM EITHER **DD** OR **DD**.

2. **HETEROZYGOSITY INFERENCE**:
   - A PERSON WITH POLYDACTYLY WHO HAS CHILDREN WITH NORMAL DIGITS MUST BE HETEROZYGOUS (**DD**), AS THEY PASS A RECESSIVE ALLELE (D) TO THEIR OFFSPRING.
   - SIMILARLY, IF ONE PARENT WITH POLYDACTYLY HAS A PARENT WITH NORMAL DIGITS, THE CHILD MUST INHERIT A RECESSIVE ALLELE, IMPLYING THE PARENT IS HETEROZYGOUS.

### GENOTYPE ASSIGNMENTS

FROM OUR ANALYSIS, SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS IN THE PEDIGREE CAN BE ASSIGNED GENOTYPES:

- INDIVIDUALS 1, 2, 3, 16, 17, AND 18 ARE HETEROZYGOUS (**DD**).
- THOSE WITH NORMAL DIGITS ARE HOMOZYGOUS RECESSIVE (**DD**).

### PEDIGREE DIAGRAM

FIGURE 18.7 ILLUSTRATES THE INHERITANCE PATTERN IN THE FAMILY, SHOWING GENOTYPES:

```
DD (MALE WITH POLYDACTYLY)
|
|
DD (FEMALE WITH POLYDACTYLY)  DD (MALE WITH NORMAL NUMBER OF DIGITS)
|
DD (FEMALE WITH NORMAL NUMBER OF DIGITS)
```

### UNCERTAINTY IN GENOTYPES

INDIVIDUALS 5, 8, AND 12 REMAIN UNCERTAIN. THEY COULD BE EITHER HOMOZYGOUS (**DD**) OR HETEROZYGOUS (**DD**).

### GENETIC CROSS OUTCOMES

EXAMINING A CROSS BETWEEN TWO HETEROZYGOUS PARENTS (DD X DD) YIELDS THE FOLLOWING POSSIBLE OFFSPRING GENOTYPES:

- **DD**, **DD**, **DD**, AND **DD**

THIS GENETIC CROSS DEMONSTRATES THE POTENTIAL OUTCOMES OF ALLELE TRANSMISSION IN POLYDACTYLY INHERITANCE.

THROUGH THIS ANALYSIS, WE CAN MAP HOW POLYDACTYLY IS INHERITED WITHIN FAMILIES USING PEDIGREE CHARTS. UNDERSTANDING THESE PRINCIPLES AIDS IN STUDYING GENETIC TRAITS.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION: GENES AND INHERITANCE

## SEX DETERMINATION

OUR SEX IS DETERMINED BY A COMBINATION OF X AND Y CHROMOSOMES, KNOWN AS SEX CHROMOSOMES. FEMALES HAVE TWO X CHROMOSOMES IN MOST CELLS (EXCEPT EGG CELLS), WHILE MALES HAVE ONE X AND ONE Y CHROMOSOME (EXCEPT IN SPERM CELLS). THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF THE Y CHROMOSOME EFFECTIVELY DETERMINES WHETHER A ZYGOTE DEVELOPS INTO MALE OR FEMALE.

### DID YOU KNOW?
THE INHERITANCE PATTERN OF SEX IS NOT ALWAYS CONSISTENT WITHIN FAMILIES. WHILE THE PREDICTED RATIO OF MALE TO FEMALE BIRTHS IS APPROXIMATELY 1:1, THIS MAY VARY DEPENDING ON THE POPULATION SIZE AND OTHER FACTORS. THE Y CHROMOSOME INFLUENCES THE DEVELOPMENT OF MALE TRAITS, BUT IT IS NOT CONSIDERED DOMINANT IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE.

## POLYGENIC INHERITANCE

MOST GENETIC CROSSES DISCUSSED INVOLVE SINGLE GENES FOR SIMPLICITY. HOWEVER, MANY CHARACTERISTICS ARE CONTROLLED BY MULTIPLE GENES WORKING TOGETHER, A PHENOMENON KNOWN AS POLYGENIC INHERITANCE.

### DID YOU KNOW?
FOR EXAMPLE, HUMAN SKIN COLOR IS INFLUENCED BY SEVERAL GENES THAT REGULATE MELANIN PRODUCTION. EACH GENE HAS ALLELES THAT EITHER PROMOTE OR INHIBIT MELANIN PRODUCTION, RESULTING IN A WIDE RANGE OF SKIN COLOR PHENOTYPES. SIMILAR COMPLEXITIES EXIST FOR TRAITS LIKE HEIGHT AND BODY MASS.

UNDERSTANDING THESE CONCEPTS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO GRASPING GENETIC PRINCIPLES AND HOW TRAITS ARE PASSED FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION.

## PREDICTING RATIOS OF OFFSPRING FROM CROSSES BETWEEN TALL/DWARF PEA PLANTS
1. **TT X TT**: ALL OFFSPRING ARE HOMOZYGOUS DOMINANT (TT).
2. **TT X TT**: HALF THE OFFSPRING ARE HETEROZYGOUS (TT), AND HALF REMAIN HOMOZYGOUS DOMINANT (TT).
3. **TT X TT**: ALL OFFSPRING ARE HETEROZYGOUS (TT).
4. **TT X TT**: THE RATIO OF GENOTYPES IS 25% TT, 50% TT, AND 25% TT.
5. **TT X TT**: HALF THE OFFSPRING ARE HOMOZYGOUS DOMINANT (TT), AND HALF ARE HETEROZYGOUS (TT).
6. **TT X TT**: ALL OFFSPRING REMAIN HOMOZYGOUS RECESSIVE (TT).

## CRITICAL THINKING IN CATTLE
IN CATTLE, A PAIR OF ALLELES CONTROLS COAT COLOR: THE ALLELE FOR BLACK COAT COLOR IS DOMINANT OVER THE ALLELE FOR RED COAT COLOR. THE GENETIC DIAGRAM REPRESENTS A CROSS BETWEEN A PURE-BREEDING BLACK BULL AND A PURE-BREEDING RED COW.

- **B** = DOMINANT ALLELE FOR BLACK COAT COLOR.
- **B** = RECESSIVE ALLELE FOR RED COAT COLOR.

### GENOTYPES OF PURE-BREEDING PARENTS
- BLACK BULL: **BB**
- RED COW: **BB**

### TERMS:
- A **DOMINANT ALLELE** IS ONE THAT IS EXPRESSED WHEN PRESENT IN A SINGLE COPY.
- A **RECESSIVE ALLELE** IS ONLY EXPRESSED WHEN BOTH COPIES ARE PRESENT.

THIS STRUCTURED LAYOUT PROVIDES A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONCEPTS OF VARIATION, SELECTION, GENES, AND INHERITANCE WHILE ENGAGING STUDENTS WITH CRITICAL THINKING AND PROBLEM-SOLVING EXERCISES.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION: GENES AND INHERITANCE

## UNDERSTANDING GENOTYPES AND GAMETES

### KEY QUESTIONS:
- WHAT ARE THE GENOTYPES OF THE GAMETES OF EACH PARENT?
- WHAT IS THE GENOTYPE OF THE OFFSPRING?

### EXAMPLE SCENARIO:
COWS WITH THE SAME GENOTYPE AS THE OFFSPRING WERE BRED WITH BULLS THAT HAVE THE SAME GENOTYPE. WHAT GENETIC TERM DESCRIBES THIS GENOTYPE?

## PROBLEM-SOLVING ACTIVITY:
DRAW A GENETIC DIAGRAM TO DETERMINE THE RATIOS OF:
- THE GENOTYPES OF THE OFFSPRING
- THE PHENOTYPES OF THE OFFSPRING

## FLOWER COLOUR IN NASTURTIUMS:
IN NASTURTIUMS, A SINGLE PAIR OF ALLELES CONTROLS FLOWER COLOUR. THE ALLELE FOR RED FLOWER COLOUR (R) IS DOMINANT OVER THE ALLELE FOR YELLOW FLOWER COLOUR (R).

### GENETIC CROSS EXAMPLE:
THE DIAGRAM BELOW REPRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A CROSS BETWEEN A PURE-BREEDING RED-FLOWERED NASTURTIUM (RR) AND A PURE-BREEDING YELLOW-FLOWERED NASTURTIUM (RR).

#### PARENT PHENOTYPES:
- RED
- YELLOW

#### PARENT GENOTYPES:
- FEMALE: RR (RED)
- MALE: RR (YELLOW)

### GAMETES:
- FEMALE GAMETES: R
- MALE GAMETES: R

### F1 GENERATION:
- GENOTYPES OF F1: ALL RR (RED FLOWERS)

### F2 GENERATION:
TO FIND THE GENOTYPES OF THE F2 GENERATION, COMPLETE THE GENETIC DIAGRAM BELOW:

| GAMETES         | R (FROM FEMALE) | R (FROM FEMALE) |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| R (FROM MALE)    | RR (RED)         | RR (RED)         |
| R (FROM MALE)    | RR (RED)         | RR (RED)         |

### ANALYSIS:
WHAT ARE THE COLOURS OF THE FLOWERS OF A, B, C, AND D?

- ALL OFFSPRING (A, B, C, D) WILL HAVE RED FLOWERS SINCE R IS DOMINANT OVER R.

## CONCLUSION:
UNDERSTANDING THE PRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE THROUGH GENETIC DIAGRAMS HELPS PREDICT THE TRAITS OF OFFSPRING BASED ON THE GENOTYPES OF THE PARENTS.

### CYSTIC FIBROSIS

CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS AN INHERITED CONDITION AFFECTING THE RESPIRATORY AND DIGESTIVE SYSTEMS. THE DIAGRAM ILLUSTRATES CYSTIC FIBROSIS INCIDENCE IN A FAMILY OVER FOUR GENERATIONS.

THE PEDIGREE SHOWS THAT UNAFFECTED PARENTS CAN HAVE AFFECTED CHILDREN, INDICATING BOTH MUST CARRY THE RECESSIVE ALLELE. THIS SUGGESTS THAT CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS DETERMINED BY A RECESSIVE ALLELE.

#### QUESTIONS FOR ANALYSIS

1. WHAT EVIDENCE IN THE PEDIGREE INDICATES THAT CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS CAUSED BY A RECESSIVE ALLELE?  
   THE PRESENCE OF AFFECTED CHILDREN WHEN BOTH PARENTS ARE UNAFFECTED IMPLIES THAT EACH PARENT MUST CARRY AT LEAST ONE COPY OF THE RECESSIVE ALLELE, LEADING TO THE POSSIBILITY OF RECESSIVE TRAITS IN OFFSPRING.

2. DETERMINE THE GENOTYPES OF INDIVIDUALS 3, 4, AND 11.  
   INDIVIDUAL 3 IS HOMOZYGOUS RECESSIVE (CC) AS THEY ARE AFFECTED. INDIVIDUAL 4 IS LIKELY EITHER HOMOZYGOUS DOMINANT (CC) OR HETEROZYGOUS (CC), AS THEY ARE UNAFFECTED. INDIVIDUAL 11'S GENOTYPE CAN BE INFERRED FROM THEIR PARENTS' GENOTYPES.

3. DRAW GENETIC DIAGRAMS TO CALCULATE THE PROBABILITY THAT THE NEXT CHILD OF INDIVIDUALS 10 AND 11 WILL:  
   - BE MALE: THE PROBABILITY IS BASED ON SEX RATIOS, TYPICALLY 50% FOR EACH GENDER.
   - SUFFER FROM CYSTIC FIBROSIS: THIS DEPENDS ON THE GENOTYPES OF PARENTS 10 AND 11. IF BOTH ARE HETEROZYGOUS (CC), THERE'S A 25% CHANCE OF RECESSIVE (CC) OFFSPRING.

### GUINEA PIG HAIR LENGTH

IN GUINEA PIGS, THE SHORT HAIR (S) ALLELE IS DOMINANT OVER LONG HAIR (S). BREEDING TWO SHORT-HAIRED GUINEA PIGS RESULTED IN SOME LONG-HAIRED OFFSPRING.

THIS INDICATES THAT BOTH PARENTS MUST BE HETEROZYGOUS (SS), ALLOWING FOR THE PRODUCTION OF RECESSIVE (SS) OFFSPRING WITH LONG HAIR.

#### DETERMINING GENOTYPE

TO IDENTIFY A SHORT-HAIRED GUINEA PIG'S GENOTYPE, PERFORM A TEST CROSS BY BREEDING IT WITH A LONG-HAIRED GUINEA PIG (SS).  
- IF ANY OFFSPRING ARE LONG-HAIRED, THE SHORT-HAIRED PARENT IS HETEROZYGOUS (SS).  
- IF ALL OFFSPRING ARE SHORT-HAIRED, THE SHORT-HAIRED PARENT IS HOMOZYGOUS (SS).

### SKILLS DEVELOPMENT

- **ANALYSIS**: EVALUATE GENETIC INFORMATION AND PEDIGREE CHARTS.  
- **INTERPRETATION**: UNDERSTAND GENETIC TERMINOLOGY AND INHERITANCE PATTERNS.  
- **REASONING**: APPLY LOGICAL THINKING TO DEDUCE GENOTYPES AND PROBABILITIES BASED ON GENETIC CROSSES.
