# GENES AND INHERITANCE

How and why do we inherit features from our parents? This chapter answers these questions by looking at the work of Gregor Mendel and how he has helped us to understand the mysteries of inheritance.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

- Understand that genes exist in alternative forms called alleles which give rise to differences in inherited characteristics
- Understand the meaning of the terms dominant, recessive, homozygous, heterozygous, phenotype and genotype
- Describe patterns of monohybrid inheritance using genetic diagrams
- Predict probabilities of outcomes from monohybrid crosses
- Understand how to interpret family pedigrees
- Understand how the sex of a person is controlled by one pair of chromosomes, XX in a female and XY in a male
- Describe the determination of the sex of offspring at fertilisation, using a genetic diagram
- Understand that most phenotypic features are the result of polygenic inheritance rather than single genes

The groundbreaking research that uncovered the rules of how genes are inherited was carried out by Gregor Mendel and published in 1865. The rules of inheritance are now known as 'Mendelian genetics' in his honour.

## GREGOR MENDEL

Gregor Mendel was a monk who lived in a monastery in Brno in what is now the Czech Republic (Figure 18.1). He became interested in the science of heredity, and carried out hundreds of breeding experiments using pea plants. From his research Mendel was able to explain the laws governing inheritance.

Mendel found that for every feature or 'character' he investigated:

- a 'heritable unit' (what we now call a gene) is passed from one generation to the next
- the heritable unit (gene) can have alternative forms (we now call these different forms alleles)
- each individual must have two alternative forms (alleles) per feature
- the gametes only have one of the alternative forms (allele) per feature
- one allele can be dominant over the other.

Mendel used these ideas to predict outcomes of cross-breeding or 'crosses' between plants, which he tested in his breeding experiments. He published his results and ideas in 1865 but few people took any notice, and his work went unrecognised for many years. It wasn't until 1900 that other biologists working on inheritance rediscovered Mendel's work and realised its importance. In 1903, the connection between the behaviour of genes in Mendelian genetics and the behaviour of chromosomes in meiosis was noticed and the science of genetics was established.

## VARIATION AND SELECTION

### MENDEL'S EXPERIMENTS ON INHERITANCE

Mendel noticed that many of the features of pea plants had two alternative forms. For example, plants were either tall or very short (called a 'dwarf' variety); they either had purple or white flowers; they produced yellow seeds or green seeds. There were no intermediate forms, no pale purple flowers or green/yellow seeds or intermediate height plants. Figure 18.2 shows some of the contrasting features of pea plants that Mendel used in his breeding experiments.

| Feature      | Option 1 | Option 2   |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| seed shape   | round    | wrinkled   |
| seed colour  | yellow   | green      |
| flower colour| purple   | white      |
| pod shape    | inflated | constricted|
| pod colour   | green    | yellow     |
| stem length  | tall     | dwarf      |

Figure 18.2 Some features of pea plants used by Mendel in his breeding experiments.

### KEY POINT

In his breeding experiments, Mendel initially used only plants that had 'bred true' for several generations. For example, any tall pea plants he used came from generations of pea plants that had all been tall.

Mendel decided to investigate, systematically, the results of cross breeding plants that had contrasting features. These were the 'parent plants', referred to as 'P' in genetic diagrams. He transferred pollen from one experimental plant to another. He also made sure that the plants could not be self-fertilised.

He collected all the seeds formed, grew them and noted the features that each plant developed. These plants were the first generation of offspring, called the F₁ generation. He did not cross-pollinate these plants, but allowed them to self-fertilise. Again, he collected the seeds, grew them and noted the features that each plant developed. These plants formed the second generation of offspring or F₂ generation. When Mendel used pure-breeding tall and pure-breeding dwarf plants as his parents, he obtained the results shown in Figure 18.3.

▲ Figure 18.3 A summary of Mendel's results from breeding tall pea plants with dwarf pea plants.

Mendel obtained similar results when he carried out breeding experiments using plants with other pairs of contrasting characters (Figure 18.4). He noticed two things in particular.

■ All the plants of the F₁ generation were of one type. This type was not a blend of the two parental features, but one or the other. For example, when tall and dwarf parents were crossed, all the F₁ plants were tall.

■ There was always a 3:1 ratio of types in the F₂ generation. Three-quarters of the plants in the F₂ generation were of the type that appeared in the F₁ generation. One-quarter showed the other parental feature. For example, when tall F₁ plants were crossed, three-quarters of the F₂ plants were tall and one-quarter were dwarf.

Mendel was able to use his findings to work out how features were inherited, despite having no knowledge of chromosomes, genes or meiosis. Nowadays we can use our understanding of these ideas to explain Mendel's results.

## VARIATION AND SELECTION

### EXPLAINING MENDEL'S RESULTS

- Each feature is controlled by a gene, which is found on a chromosome.
- There are two copies of each chromosome and each gene in all body cells, except the gametes.
- The gametes have only one copy of each chromosome and each gene (i.e. one allele).
- There are two alleles of each gene.
- One allele is dominant over the other allele, which is recessive.
- When two different alleles (one dominant and one recessive) are in the same cell, only the dominant allele is expressed (shown in the appearance of the organism).
- An individual can have two dominant alleles, two recessive alleles or a dominant allele and a recessive allele in each cell.

### KEY POINT

Normally, we use the first letter of the dominant feature to represent the gene, with a capital letter indicating the dominant allele and a lower case letter the recessive allele. Tall is dominant to dwarf in pea plants, so we use T for the allele for tall and t for dwarf.

We can use the cross between tall and dwarf pea plants as an example (Figure 18.4). In pea plants, there are tall and dwarf alleles of the gene for height. We will use the symbol T for the tall allele and t for the dwarf allele. The term genotype describes the alleles each cell has for a certain feature (e.g. TT). The phenotype is the feature that results from the genotype (e.g. a tall plant).

| phenotype of parents | tall | dwarf |
|----------------------|------|-------|
| genotype of parents  | TT   | tt    |

Both parents are pure breeding. The tall parent has two alleles for tallness in each cell. The dwarf parent has two alleles for dwarfness in each cell. Because each has two copies of just one allele, we say that they are homozygous for the height gene.

### KEY POINT

It is the accepted practice in genetics diagrams to show the gene present in a gamete as a letter in a circle.

| gametes (sex cells) | T | t |
|---------------------|---|---|

The sex cells are formed by meiosis. As a result, they only have one allele each.

genotype of F₁: Tt

phenotype of F₁: all tall

The F₁ plants have one tall allele and one dwarf allele. We say that they are heterozygous for the height gene. The plants are tall because the tall allele is dominant.

The F₁ plants are allowed to self-fertilise.

gametes from the F₁ plants: male gametes (T or t), female gametes (T or t)

The sex cells are formed by meiosis and so only have one allele. Because the F₁ plants are heterozygous, half of the gametes carry the T allele and half carry the t allele.

genotypes of F₂:

| | T | t |
|-|---|---|
|T| TT| Tt|
|t| Tt| tt|

The diagram opposite is called a Punnett square. It allows you to work out the results from a genetic cross. Write the genotypes of one set of sex cells across the top of the square and those of the other sex cells down the side. Then combine the alleles in the two sets of gametes; the squares represent the possible fertilisations.

1 TT : 2 Tt : 1 tt

You can now work out the ratio of the different genotypes.

phenotypes of F₂: 3 tall : 1 dwarf

# VARIATION AND SELECTION

## GENES AND INHERITANCE

### KEY POINT

Mendel's experiments described above, all involve single genes (e.g. the gene for height, or the gene for flower colour). The name given for inheritance involving one gene is monohybrid inheritance. It is possible to draw genetic diagrams involving two or more genes (e.g height and flower colour together), but for International GCSE you only need to interpret monohybrid crosses.

It is important to remember that in genetic crosses, ratios such as 3:1 are predicted ratios. In breeding experiments the actual numbers of offspring are unlikely to exactly fit a 3:1 ratio.

Imagine you flip a coin 20 times. The most likely outcome is that you will get 10 heads and 10 tails. However, you wouldn't be surprised to get, by chance, 11 heads and 9 tails, or 8 heads and 12 tails. The same principle applies to the outcome of a breeding experiment.

For example, one of Mendel's experiments produced 787 tall plants and 277 dwarf plants. This is a ratio of 2.84:1, not quite the expected 3:1. The reason for this is that there are a number of factors that affect survival of the plants – some pollen may not fertilise some ova, some seedlings may die before they mature, and so on. These are unpredictable or 'chance' events. The numbers that Mendel found were statistically close enough to the expected 3:1 ratio, and he found the same thing when he repeated his experiments with other characteristics.

## WORKING OUT GENOTYPES – THE TEST CROSS

You cannot tell just by looking at a tall pea plant whether it is homozygous (TT) or heterozygous (Tt). Both these genotypes would appear equally tall because the tall allele is dominant.

It would help if you knew the genotypes of its parents. You could then write out a genetic cross and perhaps work out the genotype of your tall plant. If you don't know the genotypes of the parents, the only way you can find out is by carrying out a breeding experiment called a test cross.

In a test cross, the factor under investigation is the unknown genotype of an organism showing the dominant phenotype. A tall pea plant could have the genotype TT or Tt. You must control every other possible variable including the genotype of the plant you breed it with. The only genotype you can be certain of is the genotype of plants showing the recessive phenotype (in this case dwarf plants). They must have the genotype tt.

### KEY POINT

In a test cross, you breed an organism showing the dominant feature with one showing the recessive feature.

In this example, you must breed the 'unknown' tall pea plant (TT or Tt) with a dwarf pea plant (tt). You can write out a genetic cross for both possibilities (TT × tt and Tt × tt) and predict the outcome for each (Figure 18.5). You can then compare the result of the breeding experiment with the predicted outcome, to see which result matches the prediction most closely.

| genotypes of parents | TT | tt | or | Tt | tt |
|----------------------|----|----|----|----|----| 
| gametes | T | t | or | T and t | t |
| | | | | T | Tt |
| | | | | t | tt |
| genotypes of F₁ | all Tt | | or | 1 Tt : 1 tt |
| phenotypes of F₁ | all tall | | or | 50% tall and 50% dwarf |

Figure 18.5 A test cross

From our crosses we would expect:

- all the offspring to be tall if the tall parent was homozygous (TT)
- half the offspring to be tall and half to be dwarf if the tall parent was heterozygous (Tt).

                                                WAYS OF PRESENTING GENETIC INFORMATION
                                              Writing out a genetic cross is a useful way of showing how genes are passed
                                              through one or two generations, starting from the parents To show a family
                                              history of a genetic condition requires more than this. We can use a diagram
                                              called a pedigree_
                                              Polydactyly is an inherited condition in which a person develops an extra digit
                                              (finger or toe) on the hands and feet: It is determined by a dominant allele. The
                                              recessive allele causes the normal number of digits to develop.
                                              If we use the symbol D for the polydactyly allele and d for the normal-number
                                              allele, the possible genotypes and phenotypes are:
                                                 DD   person has polydactyly (has two dominant polydactyly alleles)

                                              We don't use P and p to represent the alleles as you would expect; because
                                              the letters P and p look very similar and could easily be confused: The
                                              pedigree for polydactyly is shown in Figure 18.6.

                                              We can extract a lot of information from a pedigree. In this case:
                                                 there are four generations shown (individuals are arranged in four horizontal
                                                 lines)
                                                 individuals 4, 5 and 6 are children of individuals and 2 (a family line
                                                 connects each one directly to   and 2)
                                                 individual 4 is the first-born child of and 2 (the first-born child is shown to
                                                 the left; then second born to the right of this, then the third born and so on)
                                                 individuals 3 and 7 are not children of 1 and 2 (no family line connects them
                                                 directly to and 2)
                                                 individuals 3 and 4 are father and mother of the same children  as are
                                                 and 2, 6 and 7, 8 and 9, 12 and 13, 14 and 15 (a horizontal line joins them)
                                              It is usually possible to work out which allele is dominant from a pedigree. You
                                              look for a situation where two parents show the same feature and at least one
                                              child shows the contrasting feature. In Figure 18.6, individuals and 2 both have
                                              polydactyly; but children 4 and 6 do not: There is only one way to explain this:
---
VARIATION AND SELECTION                  GENES AND INHERITANCE                                                        217

- the normal alleles in 4 and 6 can only have come from their parents (1 and 2), so 1 and 2 must both carry normal alleles
- 1 and 2 show polydactyly, so they must have polydactyly alleles as well
- if they have both polydactyly alleles and normal alleles but show polydactyly, the polydactyly allele must be the dominant allele.

Now that we know which allele is dominant, we can work out most of the genotypes in the pedigree. All the people with the normal number of digits must have the genotype dd (if they had even one D allele, they would show polydactyly). All the people with polydactyly must have at least one polydactyly allele (they must be either DD or Dd).

From here, we can begin to work out the genotypes of the people with polydactyly. To do this we need to remember that people with the normal number of digits must inherit one 'normal-number' allele from each parent, and also that people with the normal number of digits will pass on one 'normal-number' allele to each of their children.

From this we can say that any person with polydactyly who has children with the normal number of digits must be heterozygous (the child must have inherited one of their two 'normal-number' alleles from this parent), and also that any person with polydactyly who has one parent with the normal number of digits must also be heterozygous (the 'normal-number' parent can only have passed on a 'normal-number' allele). Individuals 1, 2, 3, 16, 17 and 18 fall into one or other of these categories and must be heterozygous.

We can now add this genetic information to the pedigree. This is shown in Figure 18.7.

[A pedigree diagram is shown with the following structure and genotypes:

- Top level: Dd (1) - Dd (2)
- Second level: Dd (3) - dd (4) | D (5) - dd (6) | dd (7)
- Third level: D (8) - dd (9) | dd (10) | dd (11) | D (12) - dd (13) | dd (14) | dd (15)

We are still uncertain about individuals 5, 8 and 12. They could be homozygous or heterozygous. For example, individuals 1 and 2 are both heterozygous. Figure 18.8 shows the possible outcomes from a genetic cross between them. Individual 5 could be any of the outcomes indicated by the shading. It is impossible to distinguish between DD and Dd.

## SEX DETERMINATION

Our sex – whether we are male or female – is not under the control of a single gene. It is determined by the X and Y chromosomes – the sex chromosomes. As well as the 44 non-sex chromosomes, there are two X chromosomes in all cells of females (except the egg cells) and one X and one Y chromosome in all cells of males (except the sperm). Our sex is effectively determined by the presence or absence of the Y chromosome. The full chromosome complement of male and female is shown in Figure 16.4 on page 198.

The inheritance of sex follows the pattern shown in Figure 18.9. In any one family, however, this ratio may well not be met. Predicted genetic ratios are usually only met when large numbers are involved. The overall ratio of male and female births in all countries is 1 : 1.

| phenotypes of parents | male | female |
|------------------------|------|--------|
| genotypes of parents   | XY   | XX     |
| gametes                | X and Y | X    |

female gametes: X

male gametes: X, XY

ratio of genotypes: 50% XX : 50% XY
ratio of phenotypes: 50% female : 50% male

Figure 18.9 Determination of sex in humans

### DID YOU KNOW?

Because the Y chromosome, when present, causes a zygote to develop into a male, some people describe it it as 'dominant'. This is incorrect: dominant and recessive are terms that are only applied to individual alleles.

## POLYGENIC INHERITANCE

All of the genetic crosses that you have seen in this chapter have been examples of inheritance involving single genes. The reason for this is that it is easier to draw genetics diagrams and explain what is happening if we start by considering alleles of a single gene. However, many characteristics are controlled by two or more genes working together. This is called polygenic inheritance.

A good example is human skin colour. Darker skins contain greater amounts of a black pigment called melanin. This is controlled by several genes, which act together to determine the amount of melanin in the skin. Each gene has alleles that promote melanin production and alleles which do not. This produces a wide range of phenotypes (Figure 18.10).

### DID YOU KNOW?

Melanin protects the skin against the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation, which is a mutagen that can cause skin cancer.

Figure 18.10 Skin colour depends on the amount of melanin in the skin. It is a result of polygenic inheritance.

Other human characteristics determined by several genes (polygenes) are human height and body mass (weight).

   A 1:1            B 2:1           C 1:0            D 3:1

3. The allele for yellow coat colour in mice (Y) is dominant to the allele for non-yellow coat colour (y).
   Mice with the genotype yy have non-yellow coats.
   Mice with the genotype Yy have yellow coats.
   Mice with the genotype YY die as embryos.
   Two heterozygous mice were crossed. What is the probability that a surviving mouse in the F1 generation will be yellow?
   A 0.00           B 0.25           C 0.50           D 0.67

4. Predict the ratios of offspring from the following crosses between tall/dwarf pea plants.
   a TT × TT
   b TT × Tt
   c TT × tt
   d Tt × Tt
   e Tt × tt
   f tt × tt.

6 In nasturtiums, a single pair of alleles controls flower colour.
  The allele for red flower colour is dominant over the allele for yellow flower
  colour. The diagram represents the results of a cross between a pure-
  breeding red-flowered nasturtium and a pure-breeding yellow-flowered
  nasturtium. R = dominant allele for red flower colour; r = recessive allele for
  yellow flower colour.
