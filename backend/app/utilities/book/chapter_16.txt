# CHROMOSOMES, GENES AND DNA

This chapter looks at the structure and organisation of genetic material, namely chromosomes, genes and DNA

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

- Understand that the nucleus of a cell contains chromosomes on which genes are located
- Understand that a gene is a section of a molecule of DNA that codes for a specific protein
- Know that in human cells the diploid number of chromosomes is 46 and the haploid number is 23
- Understand that the genome is the entire DNA of an organism
- Understand that mutation is a rare, random change in genetic material that can be inherited
- Understand how genes exist in alternative forms called alleles, which give rise to different inherited characteristics

The chemical that is the basis of inheritance in nearly all organisms is DNA. DNA consists of two strands looking like a twisted ladder - the famous 'double helix'. The 'sides' of the ladder are made of alternating sugar and phosphate groups. The 'rungs' of the ladder are made of pairs of nitrogen-containing groups called bases (Figure 16.2). There are four bases called adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine. The base adenine always pairs with thymine, and cytosine with guanine. These are called complementary base pairs. DNA is usually found in the nucleus of a cell, in the chromosomes (Figure 16.1).

A small section of DNA that determines a particular feature is called a gene. Genes determine features by instructing cells to produce particular proteins which then lead to the development of the feature. So a gene can also be described as a section of DNA that codes for a particular protein.

DNA can replicate (make an exact copy of) itself. When a cell divides by mitosis (see Chapter 17), each new cell receives exactly the same type and amount of DNA. The cells formed are genetically identical.

## THE STRUCTURE OF CHROMOSOMES

Each chromosome contains one double-stranded DNA molecule. The DNA is folded and coiled so that it can be packed into a small space. The DNA is coiled around proteins called histones (Figure 16.3).

[A detailed diagram showing the structure of a chromosome, labeled as Figure 16.3. The diagram illustrates:]

- A zoomed-in view of the DNA structure, showing:
  - "supercoiled DNA/histones"
  - "DNA coiled around histones"
  - "histones"
  - "DNA" (shown as a double helix)

Because a chromosome contains a particular DNA molecule, it will also contain the genes that make up that DNA molecule. Another chromosome will contain a different DNA molecule, and so will contain different genes.

## HOW MANY CHROMOSOMES?

Nearly all human cells contain 46 chromosomes. The photographs in Figure 16.4 show the 46 chromosomes from the body cells of a human male.

[An image showing 23 pairs of chromosomes arranged in a grid, numbered 1-22, plus X and Y]

Figure 16.4 A man's chromosomes. One of each of the 22 homologous pairs are shown, along with the X and Y sex chromosomes. A woman's chromosomes are the same, except that she has two X chromosomes. A picture of all the chromosomes in a cell is called a karyotype.

The chromosomes are not arranged like this in the cell. The original photograph has been cut up and chromosomes of the same size and shape 'paired up'. The cell from the male has 22 pairs of chromosomes and two that do not form a pair â€“ the X and Y chromosomes. A body cell from a female has 23 matching pairs including a pair of X chromosomes.

## REMINDER

Red blood cells have no nucleus and therefore no chromosomes. (The lack of a nucleus means there is more room for carrying oxygen.)

## KEY POINT

The X and the Y chromosomes are the sex chromosomes. They determine whether a person is male or female (see Chapter 18).

                                       Pairs of matching chromosomes are called homologous pairs. Theycarry
                                       genes for the same features, and these genes are arranged at the same
                                       positions and sequence along the chromosome (Figure 16.5). Cells with
                                       chromosomes in pairslikethis are diploid cells_
                                                             homologous pair of chromosomes

                                                                       gene

                                                                       gene

                                         Figure 16.5 Both chromosomes in a homologous pair have the same sequence of genes.
                                       Not all human cells have 46 chromosomes_ Red blood cells have no nucleus
                                       and so have none: Sex cells have only 23 just half the number of other
                                       cells:Theyare formed by a cell division called meiosis (see Chapter 17).
                                       Each cell formed has one chromosome from each homologous pair; and one
                                       of the sex chromosomes. Cells with only half the normal diploid number of
                                       chromosomes_ and therefore only half the DNA content of other cells, are
                                       haploid cells_
                                       When two gametes fuse in fertilisation, the two nuclei join to form a single
                                       diploid cell (a zygote) This cell has; once again, all its chromosomes in
                                       homologous pairs and two copies ofeverygene: It has the normal DNA
                                       content

HOW MANY GENES?                        The entire DNA of an organism (the amount present in a diploid cell) is known
                                       as its genome_ The human genome is made up of about 3.2 billion base
                                                                                               biology is that only
                                       pairs. One of the surprise discoveries of modern molecular
                                       a small fraction of the genome consists of protein-coding genes For example,
                                       the human genome contains about 20 000-25 000 genes coding for proteins,
                                       which is only about 1.5% of the total DNA The rest have other functions,
                                       functions    to be discoveredl (See the 'Looking ahead' feature at the end of
                                                yet

 GENES AND ALLELES                     Genes are sections of DNA that control the production of proteins in a cell:
                                       Each protein contributes towards a particular body feature. Sometimes the
                                       feature is visible, such as eye colour or skin pigmentation. Sometimes the
                                       feature is not visible, such as the type of haemoglobin in red blood cells or the
                                       type of blood group antigen on the red blood cells_
                                       Some genes have more than one form: For example; the genes controlling
                                       several facial features have alternative forms, which result in alternative forms
                                       of the feature (Figure 16.6).

                                        allele is dominant: This means that it will show its effect; whether or not the

                                         LOOKING AHEAD         REGULATING GENES
                                           You have seen how 'normal' gene coding for proteins (known as structural
                                           genes) make up only 1.5% of the genome. Some of the rest of the genome is
                                           DNA that regulates the action of the structural genes, switching them on and
                                                off. One way this happens is in regions of the DNA called operons
                                           An operon is a group of structural genes headed by a non-coding length
                                           of DNA called an operator; along with another sequence of DNA called
                                                promoter: The promoter starts transcription by binding to an enzyme
                                           called RNA polymerase. Close to the promoter is a regulatory gene, which
                                           codes for a protein called a repressor: The repressor can bind with the
                                           operator; preventing the promoter from binding with RNA polymerase,
                                           and stopping transcription (Figure 16.8).

                                          Figure 16.8 An operon is a group of structural genes linked to an operator and a promoter: It is
                                          under the control of a regulatory gene.
                                        The structural genes are in groups because they are related e.g: they code
                                        for different enzymes in a metabolic pathway: Operons were first discovered
                                        in bacteria: At first we thought they only existed in prokaryotes, but molecular
                                        biologists have now found them in eukaryotic cells too.
