# CHAPTER 16: CHROMOSOMES, GENES, AND DNA

THIS CHAPTER EXPLORES THE STRUCTURE AND ORGANIZATION OF GENETIC MATERIAL, FOCUSING ON CHROMOSOMES, GENES, AND DNA.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

BY THE END OF THIS CHAPTER, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO:
- UNDERSTAND THAT THE NUCLEUS CONTAINS CHROMOSOMES WHERE GENES ARE LOCATED.
- RECOGNIZE THAT HUMAN CELLS HAVE 46 DIPLOID CHROMOSOMES AND 23 HAPLOID CHROMOSOMES.
- COMPREHEND THAT A GENE IS A SPECIFIC SEGMENT OF DNA ENCODING A PROTEIN.
- APPRECIATE THAT MUTATIONS ARE RARE, RANDOM CHANGES IN GENETIC MATERIAL THAT CAN BE INHERITED.
- UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF ALLELES, WHICH COME IN ALTERNATIVE FORMS AND CONTRIBUTE TO INHERITED TRAITS.
- KNOW THAT THE GENOME REFERS TO AN ORGANISM'S COMPLETE SET OF DNA.

## DID YOU KNOW?

DNA STANDS FOR DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID. THE TERM "DEOXYRIBO" DERIVES FROM THE FIVE-CARBON SUGAR IN DNA, DEOXYRIBOSE.

## STRUCTURE OF DNA

DNA IS A CHEMICAL BASIS OF INHERITANCE IN MOST ORGANISMS. IT CONSISTS OF TWO STRANDS FORMING A DOUBLE HELIX STRUCTURE.

- **THE SIDES OF THE LADDER**: ALTERNATING SUGAR AND PHOSPHATE GROUPS.
- **THE RUNGS OF THE LADDER**: PAIRS OF NITROGEN-CONTAINING BASESâ€”ADENINE, THYMINE, CYTOSINE, GUANINE.

## COMPLEMENTARY BASE PAIRS

ADENINE (A) PAIRS WITH THYMINE (T), AND CYTOSINE (C) PAIRS WITH GUANINE (G). THESE PAIRINGS ARE KNOWN AS COMPLEMENTARY BASE PAIRS.

## GENES AND THEIR FUNCTION

A GENE IS A SEGMENT OF DNA THAT CODES FOR A SPECIFIC PROTEIN. THIS DETERMINES PARTICULAR TRAITS, MAKING GENES THE GENETIC UNITS OF HEREDITY.

## DNA REPLICATION

DNA REPLICATES TO FORM EXACT COPIES, ENSURING EACH CELL IN MITOSIS HAS IDENTICAL DNA, LEADING TO GENETICALLY IDENTICAL CELLS.

## VISUAL AIDS

- **FIGURE 16.2**: SHOWS A DNA MOLECULE'S STRUCTURE, HIGHLIGHTING THE DOUBLE HELIX AND BASE ARRANGEMENT.

UNDERSTANDING DNA'S STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION IS FUNDAMENTAL TO GENETICS AND INHERITANCE STUDIES.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION

## CHROMOSOMES, GENES, AND DNA

### THE STRUCTURE OF CHROMOSOMES

EACH CHROMOSOME CONTAINS ONE DOUBLE-STRANDED DNA MOLECULE. THIS DNA IS FOLDED AND COILED TO FIT INTO A COMPACT SPACE, WINDING AROUND PROTEINS CALLED HISTONES.

**KEY POINT:** THE X AND Y CHROMOSOMES ARE THE SEX CHROMOSOMES THAT DETERMINE GENDER.

### HOW MANY CHROMOSOMES?

HUMAN CELLS TYPICALLY CONTAIN 46 CHROMOSOMES. FIGURE 16.3 ILLUSTRATES THIS STRUCTURE, SHOWING HOW DNA WINDS AROUND HISTONES. IN FIGURE 16.4, A KARYOTYPE OF A HUMAN MALE IS DEPICTED, DISPLAYING 22 PAIRS OF HOMOLOGOUS CHROMOSOMES AND THE X AND Y SEX CHROMOSOMES. A FEMALE'S KARYOTYPE INCLUDES 23 PAIRS, WITH TWO X CHROMOSOMES.

CHROMOSOMES IN A CELL ARE NOT ARRANGED AS SHOWN; INSTEAD, THEY PAIR BY SIZE AND SHAPE. MALE CELLS HAVE 22 PAIRS PLUS THE X AND Y CHROMOSOMES, WHILE FEMALE CELLS HAVE 23 PAIRS, INCLUDING AN ADDITIONAL X CHROMOSOME.

### REMINDER

RED BLOOD CELLS LACK NUCLEI AND THEREFORE DO NOT CONTAIN CHROMOSOMES. THIS ABSENCE ALLOWS THEM TO CARRY MORE OXYGEN EFFICIENTLY.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION: CHROMOSOMES, GENES, AND DNA

## CHROMOSOMES AND THEIR STRUCTURE

PAIRS OF MATCHING CHROMOSOMES IN CELLS ARE CALLED **HOMOLOGOUS PAIRS**. THESE PAIRS CARRY GENES FOR IDENTICAL FEATURES AND SHARE THE SAME SEQUENCE ARRANGEMENT ON EACH CHROMOSOME (SEE FIGURE 16.5).

### KEY TERMS:
- **DIPLOID CELLS**: CELLS WITH PAIRED CHROMOSOMES, CONTAINING 46 CHROMOSOMES IN HUMANS.
- **HAPLOID CELLS**: CELLS WITH HALF THE NUMBER OF CHROMOSOMES, SUCH AS 23 IN SEX CELLS.

NOT ALL HUMAN CELLS HAVE 46 CHROMOSOMES. FOR INSTANCE:
- **RED BLOOD CELLS**: THESE ANUCLEAR CELLS LACK CHROMOSOMES.
- **SEX CELLS (GAMETES)**: FORMED THROUGH MEIOSIS, EACH CELL CONTAINS ONE CHROMOSOME FROM EACH HOMOLOGOUS PAIR AND A SEX CHROMOSOME.

WHEN TWO GAMETES FUSE DURING FERTILIZATION, THEY FORM A **ZYGOTE**, A DIPLOID CELL WITH PAIRED CHROMOSOMES AND NORMAL DNA CONTENT.

## HOW MANY GENES?

THE COMPLETE DNA IN AN ORGANISM IS CALLED ITS **GENOME**. IN HUMANS, THIS CONSISTS OF APPROXIMATELY **3.2 BILLION BASE PAIRS**. SURPRISINGLY, ONLY ABOUT **1.5%** OF THE GENOME CODES FOR PROTEINS, CONTAINING AROUND **20,000-25,000 GENES**.

## GENES AND ALLELES

**GENES** ARE SPECIFIC DNA SEGMENTS CONTROLLING PROTEIN PRODUCTION, INFLUENCING TRAITS LIKE EYE COLOR OR BLOOD TYPE. SOME GENES HAVE MULTIPLE FORMS CALLED **ALLELES**, AFFECTING FACIAL FEATURES OR BLOOD GROUP ANTIGENS (SEE FIGURE 16.6).

UNDERSTANDING CHROMOSOMES, GENES, AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO STUDYING VARIATION AND SELECTION IN BIOLOGY. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DIPLOID AND HAPLOID CELLS, ALONG WITH GENE ROLES, PROVIDES A FOUNDATION FOR GENETIC INHERITANCE STUDIES.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION

## CHROMOSOMES, GENES, AND DNA

### UNDERSTANDING ALLELES

GENES ARE SEGMENTS OF DNA THAT DETERMINE SPECIFIC TRAITS IN AN ORGANISM. EACH GENE CAN HAVE DIFFERENT FORMS, KNOWN AS **ALLELES**. FOR EXAMPLE, THE GENE RESPONSIBLE FOR EARLOBE ATTACHMENT CAN HAVE TWO ALLELES: ONE FOR **ATTACHED EARLOBES** AND ONE FOR **FREE EARLOBES**.

### EXAMPLES OF ALLELES

THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLES ILLUSTRATE VARIOUS FACIAL FEATURES AND THEIR CORRESPONDING ALLELES:

- **EARLOBE ATTACHMENT**: 
  - FREE EARLOBE
  - ATTACHED EARLOBE

- **UPPER EYELID FOLD**: 
  - UPPER EYELID NOT FOLDED
  - UPPER EYELID FOLDED

- **ANGLE OF EYES TO NOSE**: 
  - EYES ANGLED AWAY FROM NOSE
  - EYES ANGLED TOWARDS NOSE

- **LENGTH OF EYELASHES**: 
  - LONG EYELASHES
  - SHORT EYELASHES

### HOMOLOGOUS CHROMOSOMES

HOMOLOGOUS CHROMOSOMES ARE PAIRS OF CHROMOSOMES THAT CARRY GENES FOR THE SAME FEATURES IN THE SAME SEQUENCE. HOWEVER, THE ALLELES OF THESE GENES MAY DIFFER. FOR INSTANCE:

- **A AND A**: DIFFERENT ALLELES OF THE SAME GENE
- **B AND B**: DIFFERENT ALLELES OF THE SAME GENE
- **C AND C**: DIFFERENT ALLELES OF THE SAME GENE

THESE ALLELES CONTROL THE SAME FEATURE BUT CAN RESULT IN DIFFERENT EXPRESSIONS.

### GENETIC COMBINATIONS

EACH CELL IN AN ORGANISM TYPICALLY CONTAINS TWO COPIES OF EACH CHROMOSOME, AND THEREFORE TWO COPIES OF EACH GENE. FOR EXAMPLE, IF A PERSON HAS ONE ALLELE FOR ATTACHED EARLOBES AND ONE FOR FREE EARLOBES, THIS SCENARIO ILLUSTRATES THE CONCEPT OF **DOMINANCE** IN GENETICS, WHERE ONE ALLELE MAY MASK THE EXPRESSION OF ANOTHER. THIS UNDERSTANDING IS CRUCIAL FOR STUDYING VARIATION AND SELECTION IN BIOLOGY.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION

IN GENETICS, UNDERSTANDING THE CONCEPTS OF CHROMOSOMES, GENES, AND ALLELES IS CRUCIAL FOR STUDYING VARIATION AND SELECTION.

### KEY TERMS:
- **GENE**: A SEGMENT OF DNA THAT CODES FOR A SPECIFIC PROTEIN OR FUNCTION.
- **ALLELE**: DIFFERENT FORMS OF A GENE THAT CAN EXIST AT A SPECIFIC LOCUS ON A CHROMOSOME.

### EXAMPLE: EARLOBE SHAPE
THE TRAIT FOR EARLOBE SHAPE ILLUSTRATES GENETIC VARIATION. THERE ARE TWO ALLELES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS TRAIT:
- **FREE EARLOBES** (DOMINANT ALLELE)
- **ATTACHED EARLOBES** (RECESSIVE ALLELE)

AN INDIVIDUAL EXHIBITS THE FREE EARLOBE TRAIT IF THEY POSSESS ONE OR MORE DOMINANT ALLELES. THE RECESSIVE ALLELE IS ONLY EXPRESSED WHEN BOTH ALLELES ARE RECESSIVE.

### DNA REGULATION
WHILE STRUCTURAL GENES ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 1.5% OF THE GENOME, THE REMAINING DNA PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN REGULATING THESE GENES. THIS REGULATION IS ESSENTIAL FOR SWITCHING GENES ON AND OFF, CONTROLLING THEIR EXPRESSION LEVELS.

#### OPERONS
AN OPERON IS A GROUP OF STRUCTURAL GENES CONTROLLED BY A SINGLE OPERATOR AND PROMOTER. THE PROMOTER FACILITATES TRANSCRIPTION BY BINDING RNA POLYMERASE, WHILE THE OPERATOR CAN BE BOUND BY A REPRESSOR PROTEIN TO INHIBIT TRANSCRIPTION. FIGURE 16.8 ILLUSTRATES THIS STRUCTURE, SHOWING HOW AN OPERON FUNCTIONS AS A REGULATORY MECHANISM.

### IMPORTANCE OF OPERONS
OPERONS ARE COMMONLY FOUND IN BACTERIA, WHERE THEY COORDINATE GENE EXPRESSION IN METABOLIC PATHWAYS. INTERESTINGLY, OPERONS HAVE ALSO BEEN DISCOVERED IN EUKARYOTIC CELLS, EXPANDING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF GENE REGULATION.
