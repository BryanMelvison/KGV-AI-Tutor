Since humans first appeared on Earth, our numbers have grown dramatically (Figure 15.2). The secret of our success has been our intelligence. Unlike other species, we have not adapted to one specific environment, we have changed many environments to suit our needs.

| Year | Population (billions) |
|------|----------------------|
| 1100 | 0.3                  |
| 1200 | 0.4                  |
| 1300 | 0.4                  |
| 1400 | 0.4                  |
| 1500 | 0.5                  |
| 1600 | 0.6                  |
| 1700 | 0.7                  |
| 1800 | 1.0                  |
| 1900 | 1.7                  |
| 2000 | 9.0                  |

Figure 15.2 The rate of increase of the human population has been particularly steep over the last 200 years. The curve has been extended to 2050, showing that the population is expected to reach 10 billion by that date.

As our numbers have grown, so has the sophistication of our technology. Early humans made tools from materials readily to hand. Today's technology involves much more complex processes. As a result, we produce ever-increasing amounts of materials that pollute our air, soil and waterways.

Early humans influenced their environment, but the enormous size of the population today and the extent of our industries mean that we affect the environment much more significantly. We make increasing demands on the environment for:

- food to sustain an ever-increasing population
- materials to build homes, schools and industries
- fuel to heat homes and power vehicles
- space in which to build homes, schools and factories, as well as for leisure facilities
- space in which to dump our waste materials.

                                                The 'greenhouse effect' doesn't just happen to the Earth, but also in
                                                greenhousesl Short wavelength infrared radiation entering the glasshouse
                                                is absorbed and re-radiated as longer wavelength infrared radiation: This
                                                radiation cannot escape through the glass, so the glasshouse heats up
                                                (see the section on the Earth's greenhouse effect later in this chapter: The

                                                temperature is too low:
                                                If heaters use fossil fuels such as gas, this produces carbon dioxide and water

                                                vapour maintains a moist atmosphere and reduces water loss by transpiration:

                                               canmaximise his yield: Heating above this temperature is a waste of money as there
                                               is no further increase in yield.

CYCLING NUTRIENTS ON A FARM             In Chapter 14 you saw how carbon is cycled in nature. On a farm, the situation
                                        is quite different; particularly with regard to the circulation of nitrogen
                                        Nitrates from the soil supply nitrogen that is needed to make proteins in plants_
                                        Some of these plants are crops that will be sold; others are used as food
                                        for the stock animals (fodder). When the crops are sold; the nitrogen in the
                                        proteins goes with them and is lost from the farm ecosystem: Similarly, when
                                        livestock is sold, the nitrogen in their proteins (gained from the fodder) goes
                                        with them and is lost from the farm ecosystem To replace the lost nitrogen, a
                                        farmer usually adds some kind of fertiliser: The amount of fertiliser added must
                                        becarefully monitored to ensure the maximum growth and yield of the crop
                                        using excess fertiliser wastes money:

FERTILISERS INCREASE CROP               There are two main types of fertilisers organic and inorganic.Manyorganic
YIELD                                   fertilisers (such as farmyard manure) are made from the faeces of farm animals
                                        mixed with straw: Inorganic fertilisers are simply inorganic compounds such
                                        as potassium nitrate or ammonium nitrate , carefully formulated to provide a
                                        specific amount of nitrate (or some other ion) when applied according to the
                                        manufacturer's instructions
---
Adding farmyard manure returns some nitrogen to the soil. But, as farmyard manure is made from livestock faeces and indigestible fodder, it can only replace a portion of the lost nitrogen. Most farmers apply inorganic fertilisers to replace the nitrates and other mineral ions lost. While this can replace all the lost ions, it can also lead to pollution problems, which we will discuss later. Inorganic fertilisers do not improve soil structure in the way that organic fertilisers can, because they do not contain any decaying matter that is an essential part of the soil.

Another way to replace lost nitrates is to grow a legume crop (e.g. clover) in a field one year in four. Legumes have nitrogen-fixing bacteria in nodules on their roots. These bacteria convert nitrogen gas in the soil air to ammonium ions. Some of this is passed to the plants, which use it to make proteins. At the end of the season, the crop is ploughed back into the soil, and decomposers convert the nitrogen in the proteins to ammonia. This is then oxidised to nitrate by nitrifying bacteria and made available for next year's crop.

## PEST CONTROL

Pests are organisms that reduce the yield of crop plants or stock animals. The 'yield' of a crop is the amount produced for sale. A pest can harm this in two ways:

- lowering the amount by reducing growth, e.g. by damaging leaves and reducing photosynthesis
- affecting the appearance or quality of a crop, making it unsuitable for sale (Figure 15.6).

> **DID YOU KNOW?**
> In Britain, about 30% of the potential maize crop is lost to weeds, insects and fungal diseases (Figure 15.6).

Any type of organism – plants, animals, bacteria, fungi or protoctists, as well as viruses – can be a pest. Pests can be controlled in a number of ways. Chemicals called pesticides can be used to kill them, or their numbers can be reduced by using biological control methods.

Pesticides are named according to the type of organism they kill:

- herbicides kill plant pests (they are weedkillers)
- insecticides kill insects
- fungicides kill fungi
- molluscicides kill snails and slugs.

A farmer uses pesticides to kill particular pests and improve the yield from

the crops or livestock. Pests are only a problem when they are present in big enough numbers to cause economic damage – a few whiteflies in a tomato crop are not a problem; the real damage arises when there are millions of them. Whether or not a farmer uses pesticides is largely a decision based on cost. The increase in income due to higher yields must be set against the cost of the pesticides.

## PROBLEMS WITH PESTICIDES

One problem with using pesticides is that a pest may develop resistance to the chemical. This happens through natural selection (see Chapter 19). It makes the existing pesticide useless, so that another must be found. Other problems are to do with the fact that pesticides can cause environmental damage. There are several reasons for this:

- they may be slow to decompose – they are persistent in the environment
- they build up in the tissues of organisms – bioaccumulation
- they build up and become more concentrated along food chains – biomagnification
- they kill other insects that are harmless, as well as helpful species, such as bees.

An ideal pesticide should:
- control the pest effectively
- be biodegradable, so that no toxic products are left in the soil or on crops
- be specific, so that only the pest is killed
- not accumulate in organisms
- be safe to transport, store and apply
- be easy to apply.

We can explain these problems by looking at one well-documented example – the insecticide DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane).

DDT was invented in 1874, and first discovered to be an insecticide in 1939. In World War II it was used with great success to kill malaria carrying mosquitoes and the lice that carried typhus. Its use increased up until the 1960s, when we began to understand its harmful effects. It was banned from general use in the USA in 1972, and worldwide in 2004. Limited use of DDT is still allowed for control of insects that transmit disease, although this is still regarded as controversial.

### DID YOU KNOW?

Cultivating large areas of land with a single crop (a monoculture) encourages pests. Monocultures make harvesting the crop easier. But if a pest arrives, it can easily spread through the crop. During the winter the pest can lie dormant in the soil ready to attack next year's crop. Crop rotation breaks the pest cycle. This is where a different crop is grown each year (Figure 15.7). When over-wintering pests emerge, their preferred crop is no longer there.

Figure 15.7 A three-year crop rotation

### DID YOU KNOW?

DDT is a historical case, but there are problems with many modern pesticides. One recent example involves a class of insecticides called neonicotinoids (chemicals similar to nicotine). They have been linked to several serious ecological problems, including honey bee colony collapse disorder (CCD) and loss of birds due to a reduction in insect populations.

DDT is a very effective insecticide, so why has it been banned?

- DDT is very persistent, remaining active in the environment for many years. If DDT is sprayed onto a field, around half will still be there ten years later. To make things worse, the missing half won't have degraded to harmless products – some will have broken down to form a similar compound called DDE, which is also a potent insecticide, and some will have spread to other habitats. DDT is carried all around the world by wind, and has been identified in polar ice caps and deserts, thousands of kilometres away from where it was applied.

- By the 1950s, many types of insect began to appear that were resistant to DDT. These insects had developed a genetic mutation that prevented them from being killed by the insecticide. While DDT continued to be used, the resistant insects had an advantage over the non-resistant ones. Their numbers increased with every generation since they were able to survive exposure to the pesticide. They reproduced, passing on their resistance genes to their offspring. This is an example of natural selection (see Chapter 19). There are now hundreds of examples of pest species that have
---
developed resistance to different insecticides.

- DDT doesn't just kill pests. It will kill any type of insect, including harmless ones such as butterflies and useful species such as bees, as well as natural predators such as wasps, which might themselves kill the pest insects. Insecticides damage ecosystems by disrupting food chains.

- DDT is very soluble in fats. When a herbivore feeds on plants that are contaminated with DDT, the insecticide is not broken down or excreted. Instead it becomes concentrated in the fatty tissues of the animal. This is called bioaccumulation. When a carnivore eats the herbivore this process is repeated, so that the insecticide builds up in concentration along the food chain. This is known as biomagnification (Figure 15.8). The levels at the top of the food chain may be toxic, leading to the death of the top carnivores in the chain. This can disrupt the food web of an ecosystem.

| Organism    | DDT Concentration |
|-------------|-------------------|
| plankton    | (0.000 0003)      |
| crustaceans | (0.04)            |
| small fish  | (0.5)             |
| large fish  | (2.0)             |
| fish eagle  | (25)              |

Figure 15.8 Biomagnification of DDT in a food chain

## BIOLOGICAL CONTROL

Another option that may be used to control pests is biological control. Instead of using a toxic chemical, biological control uses another organism to reduce the numbers of a pest. We have already mentioned whiteflies as pests of tomatoes. One way of controlling them in large glasshouses is to introduce a parasite that will kill the whiteflies. A tiny wasp called Encarsia parasitises and kills their larvae, reducing the numbers of adult whitefly.

A problem with biological control is that it never fully gets rid of a pest. If the control organism killed all the pests, then it too would die out, as it would have no food supply. Biological control aims to reduce pest numbers to a level where they no longer cause significant economic damage (Figure 15.9).

There are several methods of biological control. Some examples include:

- introducing a natural predator – ladybirds can be used to control the populations of aphids in orange groves

- introducing a herbivore – a moth was introduced from South America to control the prickly pear cactus that was becoming a serious weed in grazing land in Australia

- introducing a parasite – the wasp Encarsia is used to control whitefly populations in glasshouse tomato crops

- introducing a pathogenic (disease-causing) microorganism – the myxomatosis virus was deliberately released in Australia to control the rabbit population

- introducing sterile males – these mate with the females but no offspring are produced from these matings, so numbers fall

- using pheromones – these are natural chemicals produced by insects to attract a mate. They are used to attract pests (either males or females) to traps. The pests are then destroyed, reducing the reproductive potential of the population. Male-attracting pheromones are used to control aphids (greenfly) in plum crops.

# AIR POLLUTION

One definition of pollution is:

'Pollution is the contamination of the environment by harmful substances that are produced by the activities of humans'.

Human activities pollute the air with many gases. Some major examples that we will look at in this chapter are carbon dioxide, methane, carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide.

## CARBON DIOXIDE AND GLOBAL WARMING

### KEY POINT
In any one year, there is a peak and a trough in the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

The levels of carbon dioxide have been rising for several hundred years. Over the last 100 years alone, the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by nearly 30%. This rise is mainly due to the increased burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and natural gas, as well as petrol and diesel in vehicle engines. It has been made worse by cutting down large areas of tropical rainforest (see later in this chapter). These extensive forests have been called 'the lungs of the Earth' because they absorb such vast quantities of carbon dioxide and produce equally large amounts of oxygen. Extensive deforestation (see below) means that less carbon dioxide is being absorbed. Figure 15.10 shows changes in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (in parts per million) from 1960 to 2010.

Figure 15.11 Seasonal fluctuations in carbon dioxide levels

Figure 15.11 Seasonal fluctuations in carbon dioxide levels

In the autumn and winter, trees lose their leaves. Without leaves they cannot photosynthesise and so do not absorb carbon dioxide. They still respire, which produces carbon dioxide, so in the winter months, they give out carbon dioxide and the level in the atmosphere rises. In the spring and summer, with new leaves and brighter sunlight, the trees photosynthesise faster than they respire. As a result, they absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than they produce, so the level decreases. However, because there are fewer trees overall, it doesn't quite return to the low level of the previous summer.

Figure 15.10 Changes in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

Figure 15.10 Changes in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

The increased levels of carbon dioxide and other gases contribute to global warming, or the enhanced greenhouse effect. It is important to understand that the 'normal' greenhouse effect occurs naturally – without it, more heat would be lost into space and the surface temperature of the Earth would be about 30 °C lower than it is today, and life as we know it would be impossible.

Carbon dioxide is one of the 'greenhouse gases' that are present in the Earth's upper atmosphere. Other greenhouse gases include water vapour (H₂O), methane (CH₄), nitrous oxide (N₂O) and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Most greenhouse gases occur naturally, while some (like CFCs) are only produced by human activities.
---
# ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT: HUMAN INFLUENCES ON THE ENVIRONMENT

The 'normal' greenhouse effect is shown in Figure 15.12.

Greenhouse effect diagram

Short-wavelength infrared (IR) radiation from the Sun reaches the Earth. Some is absorbed by the Earth's surface and emitted again as longer-wavelength IR radiation. The greenhouse gases absorb and then re-emit some of this long-wavelength IR radiation, which would otherwise escape into space. This then heats up the surface of the Earth.

## DID YOU KNOW?

Chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs are complex organic molecules containing carbon, chlorine and fluorine. They were once widely used in fridges, spray cans and as solvents, as well as in making materials such as foam packaging. Their use was banned or phased out in many countries in 1987, when they were found to be damaging the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere. (This layer protects living organisms by absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.)

The problem is that human activities are polluting the atmosphere with extra greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. This is thought to be causing a rise in the Earth's surface temperature – the enhanced greenhouse effect, or global warming.

A rise in the Earth's temperature of only a few degrees would have many effects.

- Polar ice caps would melt and sea levels would rise.
- A change in the major ocean currents would result in warm water flowing into previously cooler areas.
- A change in global rainfall patterns could result. With a rise in temperature, there will be more evaporation from the surface of the sea, leading to more water vapour in the atmosphere and more rainfall in some areas. Other areas could experience a decrease in rainfall. Long-term climate change could occur.
- It could change the nature of many ecosystems. If species could not migrate quickly enough to a new, appropriate habitat, or adapt quickly enough to the changed conditions in their original habitat, they could become extinct.
- Changes in farming practices would be necessary as some pests became more abundant. Higher temperatures might allow some pests to complete their life cycles more quickly.

                                          Methane is a greenhouse gas, with effects similar to carbon dioxide. Although
                                          there is less methane in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, each molecule
                                          has a much bigger greenhouse effect.

 CARBON MONOXIDE                          When substances containing carbon are burned in a limited supply of oxygen,
                                          carbon monoxide (CO) is formed: This happens when petrol and diesel are
                                          burned in vehicle engines. Exhaust gases contain significant amounts of

# ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT: HUMAN INFLUENCES ON THE ENVIRONMENT

To monitor the level of pollution by sulfur dioxide, different lichens are called indicator species as they 'indicate' different levels of sulfur dioxide pollution.

| Zone | Description | Sulfur Dioxide Level |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| Zone 1 | The orange crusty lichen Xanthoria | Quite high levels |
| Zone 2 | Leafy lichens on stone (but not on trees) | Moderate levels |
| Zone 3 | Shrubby lichens on trees | Very low levels |
| Zone 4 | Usnea-type lichens on trees | Clean air |

The map in Figure 15.14 shows zones in Britain where different types of lichen are found.

## WATER POLLUTION

Two major pollutants of freshwater are sewage and minerals from fertiliser.

### POLLUTION OF WATER BY SEWAGE

Sewage is wet waste from houses, factories and farms. In developed countries where large-scale sewage treatment takes place, industrial and agricultural sewage is usually dealt with separately from household sewage. Household sewage consists of wastewater from kitchens and bathrooms and contains human urine and faeces, as well as dissolved organic and inorganic chemicals such as soaps and detergents. It is carried away in pipes called sewers, to be treated before it enters waterways such as rivers or the sea.

If sewage is discharged untreated into waterways, it produces two major problems:

- Aerobic bacteria in the water polluted by the sewage use up the dissolved oxygen in the water as they break down the organic materials. This reduction in the level of oxygen kills larger animals such as freshwater insects and fish.

- Untreated sewage contains pathogenic bacteria, which are a danger to human health.
---
ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT              HUMAN INFLUENCES ON THE ENVIRONMENT                                          187

Where untreated or 'raw' sewage enters a river, the level of oxygen in the water becomes very low as the aerobic bacteria and other microorganisms from the sewage decompose the organic matter. Only species that are adapted to live in low-oxygen conditions, such as anaerobic bacteria, can survive. As the water moves away from the outlet, it becomes oxygenated again as it mixes with clean water and absorbs oxygen from the air. The increase in dissolved oxygen levels allows more clean-water species to survive. Figure 15.15 shows the changes in oxygen content, numbers of clean-water animals, and numbers of polluted-water animals downstream from a sewage outlet.

| Distance downstream | Oxygen | Clean-water animals | Bloodworms |
|---------------------|--------|---------------------|------------|
| Sewage effluent     | High   | Low                 | Low        |
|                     | Low    | Low                 | High       |
|                     | Medium | Medium              | Medium     |
|                     | High   | High                | Low        |

Figure 15.15 Changes in oxygen levels and types of organism living downstream from a sewage outlet into a river.

The aim of sewage treatment is to remove solid and suspended organic matter and pathogenic microorganisms, so that cleaner waste can be discharged into waterways.

As with air pollution by sulfur dioxide, the level of pollution by organic material can be monitored by the presence or absence of indicator species. Figure 15.16 shows some of these.

| Species | Characteristics | Pollution Level |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Bloodworm | Gills, head; actual size shown | Heavy organic pollution |
| Caddis-fly larva | Head, legs, case made of plant matter, sand or stones; actual size including case shown | Some organic pollution |
| Stone-fly nymph | Head, tails; actual size shown | Clean water |

Figure 15.16 Some freshwater animals will only live in very clean water, while others can survive in very polluted areas.

## EUTROPHICATION

Eutrophication comes from a Greek word, meaning 'well-fed'. It refers to a situation where large amounts of nutrients enter a body of water, such as a river, lake or even the sea. The nutrients in question are inorganic mineral ions, usually nitrates or phosphates. Pollution by these minerals can have very harmful effects on an aquatic ecosystem.

There are two main sources of excess minerals:

- from untreated or treated sewage
- from artificial nitrate or phosphate fertilisers.
---
188 ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT | HUMAN INFLUENCES ON THE ENVIRONMENT

Eutrophication is often caused by the use of artificial fertiliser. Streams and rivers that run through agricultural land that have been treated with fertiliser can contain high concentrations of nitrate and phosphate. This is because nitrate is very soluble in water, and is easily washed out of the soil by rain, a process known as leaching. This is less of a problem with phosphate fertiliser, but phosphate is also washed into waterways by surface run-off of water.

The excess mineral ions stimulate the growth of all plants in the river or lake, but this is usually seen first as a rapid growth of algae, called an algal bloom. The algae can increase in numbers so rapidly that they form a thick scum on the surface of the water (Figure 15.17).

Figure 15.17 An algal bloom caused by fertiliser

The algae soon start to die, and are decomposed by aerobic bacteria in the water. Because the bacteria respire aerobically, they use up the oxygen in the water. In addition, the algae block the light from reaching other rooted plants, further decreasing the oxygen produced by photosynthesis. The low oxygen levels can result in fish and other aerobic animals dying. In severe cases, the water becomes anoxic (containing very little oxygen) and smelly from gases like hydrogen sulfide and methane from the bacteria. By this stage only anaerobic bacteria can survive.

Rapid eutrophication is less likely when farmers use organic fertiliser (manure). The organic nitrogen-containing compounds in manure are less soluble and so are leached less quickly from the soil.

REMINDER

The sequence of events following eutrophication is:
- increase in mineral ions
- algal bloom
- death of algae
- decomposition by aerobic bacteria
- bacteria use up oxygen
- fish and other animals die

# 190 ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT HUMAN INFLUENCES ON THE ENVIRONMENT

## SKILLS REASONING

6. The diagram shows how the greenhouse effect is thought to operate.

![Diagram of greenhouse effect showing Earth, short wave radiation from sun, some long wave radiation escaping into space, and some absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-emitted back to Earth]

a. Name two greenhouse gases.

b. Explain one benefit to the Earth of the greenhouse effect.

c. Suggest why global warming may lead to malaria becoming more common in Europe.

7. The diagram shows the profile of the ground on a farm either side of a pond.

![Diagram showing a cross-section of land with field 1, a pond, and field 2]

The farmer applied nitrate fertiliser to the two fields in alternate years. When he applied the fertiliser to Field 1, the pond often developed an algal bloom. This did not happen when fertiliser was applied to Field 2.

a. Explain why an algal bloom developed when he applied the fertiliser to Field 1.

b. Explain why no algal bloom developed when he applies the fertiliser to Field 2.

c. Suggest why the algal bloom is greater in hot weather.

8. Some untreated sewage was accidentally discharged into a small river. A short time afterwards, a number of dead fish are seen downstream of the point of discharge. Explain, as fully as you can, how the discharge might have led to the death of the fish.

9. Some farmers use pesticides and fertilisers to improve crop yields. Those practising 'organic' farming techniques do not use any artificial products.

a. Describe how the use of pesticides and fertilisers can improve crop yields.

## SKILLS CRITICAL THINKING

b. Explain how organic farmers can maintain fertile soil and keep their crops free of pests.
