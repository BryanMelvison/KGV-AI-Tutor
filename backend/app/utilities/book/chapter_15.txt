# HUMAN INFLUENCES ON THE ENVIRONMENT

## INTRODUCTION
HUMANS POSSESS INTELLIGENCE THAT FAR SURPASSES THAT OF ANY OTHER ANIMAL ON EARTH. THIS CHAPTER EXAMINES THE VARIOUS WAYS IN WHICH HUMAN ACTIVITIES IMPACT NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS AND THE RESULTING ECOLOGICAL ISSUES.

## KEY ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES

### THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT
THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT OCCURS WHEN HEAT IS TRAPPED IN THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE, LEADING TO GLOBAL WARMING. THIS PHENOMENON PRIMARILY RESULTS FROM AN INCREASE IN GREENHOUSE GASES, SUCH AS CARBON DIOXIDE, IN THE ATMOSPHERE.

### OZONE LAYER DEPLETION
THE OZONE LAYER IS BEING DESTROYED IN MANY REGIONS DUE TO HUMAN ACTIVITIES, ALLOWING INCREASED UV RADIATION TO REACH THE EARTH'S SURFACE.

### ACID RAIN
ACID RAIN FORMS WHEN CERTAIN PRODUCTS OF BURNING FUELS REACT WITH WATER IN THE ATMOSPHERE. THIS PROCESS RELEASES GASES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO ACID RAIN, WHICH CAN HARM ECOSYSTEMS.

### DEFORESTATION
DEFORESTATION INCREASES CARBON DIOXIDE LEVELS IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND CONTRIBUTES TO CLIMATE CHANGE. IT ALSO DESTABILIZES SOILS, LEADING TO EROSION AND LOSS OF BIODIVERSITY.

### WATER POLLUTION
THE USE OF FERTILIZERS IN AGRICULTURE CAN LEAD TO RUNOFF INTO RIVERS, CAUSING RAPID ALGAE GROWTH. THIS ALGAL BLOOM DEPLETES DISSOLVED OXYGEN IN THE WATER, HARMING AQUATIC LIFE.

### AIR POLLUTION
SMOKE FROM BURNING FUELS CONTAINS GASES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO BOTH ACID RAIN AND THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT. EXHAUST FUMES FROM VEHICLES ARE A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF THESE POLLUTANTS.

## FIGURE 15.1
THIS FIGURE ILLUSTRATES HOW INTERCONNECTED HUMAN ACTIVITIES AND THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES ARE, EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES.

## CONCLUSION
HUMAN ACTIVITIES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ENVIRONMENT, LEADING TO VARIOUS ECOLOGICAL ISSUES. UNDERSTANDING THESE INFLUENCES IS CRUCIAL FOR DEVELOPING STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE THEIR EFFECTS AND PROMOTE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH.

## THE IMPACT OF HUMAN POPULATION GROWTH

SINCE HUMANS FIRST APPEARED ON EARTH, OUR NUMBERS HAVE GROWN DRAMATICALLY. UNLIKE OTHER SPECIES, WE HAVE ADAPTED MANY ENVIRONMENTS TO SUIT OUR NEEDS THROUGH TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS.

### POPULATION GROWTH OVER TIME
THE HUMAN POPULATION HAS EXPERIENCED A STEEP RATE OF INCREASE OVER THE LAST 200 YEARS. PROJECTED ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT THE POPULATION COULD REACH 10 BILLION BY 2050.

AS OUR POPULATION GROWS, SO DOES OUR RELIANCE ON TECHNOLOGY. EARLY HUMANS USED SIMPLE TOOLS, WHILE MODERN TECHNOLOGY ENABLES COMPLEX PROCESSES, LEADING TO INCREASED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THROUGH POLLUTION AND RESOURCE EXPLOITATION.

### HUMAN DEMANDS ON THE ENVIRONMENT
THE LARGE-SCALE DEMANDS OF A GROWING POPULATION INCLUDE:
- **FOOD**: TO SUSTAIN INCREASING NUMBERS.
- **MATERIALS**: FOR BUILDING HOMES, SCHOOLS, AND INDUSTRIES.
- **FUEL**: FOR HEATING AND POWERING VEHICLES.
- **SPACE**: FOR HOUSING, INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES, AND WASTE DISPOSAL.

UNDERSTANDING THESE CONCEPTS HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES TO MITIGATE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS.

# ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT: HUMAN INFLUENCES ON THE ENVIRONMENT

## MODERN AGRICULTURE: PRODUCING THE FOOD WE NEED

MODERN FARMS OPERATE AS MANAGED ECOSYSTEMS WHERE MANY INTERACTIONS MIRROR THOSE FOUND IN NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS. CROP PLANTS RELY ON LIGHT, MINERAL IONS FROM THE SOIL, AND VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. LIVESTOCK, SUCH AS SHEEP AND CATTLE, DEPEND ON THESE CROP PLANTS FOR THEIR FOOD.

A FOOD WEB ON A FARM CONNECTS DIFFERENT ORGANISMS. GRASS AND ROOT CROPS PROVIDE FOOD FOR CATTLE AND SHEEP, WHILE POTATOES AND OTHER VEGETABLES ARE CONSUMED BY HUMANS. WHEAT, BARLEY, SUGAR BEET, AND OILSEED RAPE SUPPORT PIGS AND POULTRY. THESE PRODUCTS THEN BECOME BREAD, BREAKFAST CEREALS, AND MARGARINE FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION.

FARMERS AIM TO MAXIMIZE CROP AND LIVESTOCK YIELDS THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL TO ENSURE PROFITABILITY.

## IMPROVING YIELDS FROM CROP PLANTS

FARMERS CAN ENHANCE CROP YIELD BY CONTROLLING SEVERAL FACTORS. TABLE 15.1 SUMMARIZES THESE FACTORS AND THEIR MANAGEMENT:

### FACTORS TO IMPROVE CROP YIELD

- **SOIL IONS (E.G., NITRATES)**: FARMERS ADD FERTILIZERS OR USE HYDROPONIC CULTURE TO PROVIDE ESSENTIAL MINERAL IONS FOR PROTEIN SYNTHESIS.
- **SOIL STRUCTURE**: PLOUGHING FIELDS AND ADDING MANURE IMPROVES AERATION AND DRAINAGE, FACILITATING BETTER MINERAL ION AND WATER UPTAKE.
- **SOIL PH**: LIME IS ADDED TO ACIDIC SOILS TO ADJUST PH LEVELS, OPTIMIZING MINERAL ION AVAILABILITY.
- **CARBON DIOXIDE, LIGHT, AND HEAT**: GLASSHOUSES OR POLYTUNNELS ALTER CONDITIONS TO MAXIMIZE PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND GROWTH.

SOIL PH TYPICALLY RANGES BETWEEN 3 AND 8. IT CAN BE TESTED USING INDICATOR KITS OR PH METERS. ACIDIC SOILS ARE MADE ALKALINE BY ADDING LIME.

GLASSHOUSES AND POLYTUNNELS PROVIDE CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENTS FOR PLANT GROWTH. THEIR TRANSPARENT WALLS ALLOW SUFFICIENT NATURAL LIGHT FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS DURING SUMMER, WITH ADDITIONAL LIGHTING EXTENDING THE GROWING SEASON INTO WINTER.

IN SUMMARY, MODERN AGRICULTURE EMPLOYS VARIOUS TECHNIQUES TO MANAGE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, ENSURING HIGH CROP AND LIVESTOCK YIELDS TO MEET SOCIETAL FOOD DEMANDS.

# ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT

## HUMAN INFLUENCES ON THE ENVIRONMENT

### GREENHOUSES

THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT OCCURS IN GLASSHOUSES WHERE SHORT WAVELENGTH INFRARED RADIATION IS ABSORBED AND RE-RADIATED AS LONGER WAVELENGTH INFRARED RADIATION, PREVENTING IT FROM ESCAPING. THIS PROCESS HEATS THE GLASSHOUSE. ADDITIONALLY, GLASSHOUSES REDUCE CONVECTION CURRENTS THAT AID COOLING.

HEATING GLASSHOUSES WITH FOSSIL FUELS LIKE GAS EMITS CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER VAPOR. CARBON DIOXIDE SUPPORTS PHOTOSYNTHESIS, WHILE WATER VAPOR MAINTAINS MOISTURE, REDUCING TRANSPIRATION LOSS.

HYDROPONIC CULTURE INVOLVES GROWING PLANTS IN NUTRIENT SOLUTIONS TAILORED TO SPECIFIC CROPS, PROVIDING EXACT MINERAL BALANCES.

**KEY POINT:** OPTIMIZING TEMPERATURE FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS MAXIMIZES CROP YIELD; HEATING BEYOND THIS IS UNNECESSARY.

### CYCLING NUTRIENTS ON A FARM

THE NITROGEN CYCLE IS CRUCIAL ON FARMS. NITRATES FROM SOIL PROVIDE NITROGEN ESSENTIAL FOR PLANT PROTEINS. CROPS AND LIVESTOCK BOTH LOSE NITROGEN THROUGH SOLD PRODUCTS, NECESSITATING FERTILIZER USE TO REPLACE IT. MONITORING FERTILIZER AMOUNTS IS VITAL TO PREVENT WASTE.

**FIGURE 15.5** ILLUSTRATES NITROGEN CIRCULATION:

- NITROGEN LOSS IN PROTEIN WHEN STOCK OR CROPS ARE SOLD
- NITROGEN FROM CROPS FED TO STOCK VIA STRAW, FAECES, AND URINE
- FARMYARD MANURE AS AN ORGANIC FERTILIZER
- NITRATE TO NITRITE TO AMMONIA
- INORGANIC FERTILIZERS LIKE POTASSIUM NITRATE OR AMMONIUM NITRATE
- DECAY OF PLOWED-IN CROPS
- LEGUMES CONTRIBUTING NITROGEN GAS THROUGH SYMBIOSIS

### FERTILIZERS INCREASE CROP YIELD

FERTILIZERS ARE CATEGORIZED INTO ORGANIC (E.G., FARMYARD MANURE) AND INORGANIC (E.G., POTASSIUM NITRATE, AMMONIUM NITRATE), PROVIDING SPECIFIC NUTRIENTS WHEN APPLIED CORRECTLY.

THIS UNDERSTANDING HIGHLIGHTS THE BALANCE OF ECOSYSTEMS AND HUMAN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS.

# ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT: PEST CONTROL

IN BRITAIN, APPROXIMATELY 30% OF THE MAIZE CROP IS LOST TO WEEDS, INSECTS, AND FUNGAL DISEASES. THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT THAT PESTS CAN HAVE ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY.

A WEED IS DEFINED AS A PLANT GROWING WHERE IT IS UNWANTED. WEEDS CAN BE CONTROLLED THROUGH MECHANICAL OR CHEMICAL METHODS. MECHANICAL CONTROL INVOLVES PHYSICALLY REMOVING WEEDS, WHILE CHEMICAL CONTROL USES HERBICIDES TO ELIMINATE THEM.

HUMAN ACTIVITIES INFLUENCE THE ENVIRONMENT BY RETURNING NITROGEN TO THE SOIL THROUGH FARMYARD MANURE. HOWEVER, THIS METHOD ONLY PARTIALLY REPLACES LOST NITROGEN, PROMPTING FARMERS TO USE INORGANIC FERTILIZERS TO REPLENISH NITRATES AND MINERALS. INORGANIC FERTILIZERS CAN EFFECTIVELY REPLACE LOST IONS BUT MAY LEAD TO POLLUTION ISSUES AS THEY LACK DECAYING MATTER, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR HEALTHY SOIL STRUCTURE.

ORGANIC FERTILIZERS, SUCH AS FARMYARD MANURE, IMPROVE SOIL STRUCTURE AND PROVIDE NUTRIENTS OVER TIME. THIS MAKES THEM A VALUABLE ALTERNATIVE TO INORGANIC FERTILIZERS.

LEGUME CROPS, LIKE CLOVER, CAN HELP REPLENISH NITROGEN BY FORMING ROOT NODULES THAT HOUSE NITROGEN-FIXING BACTERIA. THESE BACTERIA CONVERT ATMOSPHERIC NITROGEN INTO AMMONIUM IONS, WHICH PLANTS USE TO PRODUCE PROTEINS. AT THE END OF THE GROWING SEASON, LEGUMES ARE PLOWED BACK INTO THE SOIL, WHERE DECOMPOSERS CONVERT THE NITROGEN IN PROTEINS INTO AMMONIA. THIS AMMONIA IS THEN OXIDIZED BY NITRIFYING BACTERIA INTO NITRATE, MAKING IT AVAILABLE FOR SUBSEQUENT CROPS.

PESTS ARE ORGANISMS THAT REDUCE CROP OR STOCK YIELDS. THEY CAN HARM YIELD BY EITHER REDUCING PRODUCTION THROUGH DAMAGE TO PLANT STRUCTURES OR AFFECTING CROP QUALITY, MAKING IT UNSUITABLE FOR SALE.

THE TYPES OF PESTS INCLUDE A WIDE RANGE OF ORGANISMS, SUCH AS PLANTS, ANIMALS, BACTERIA, FUNGI, PROTOCTISTS, AND VIRUSES. EACH OF THESE CAN POTENTIALLY BE A PEST, DEPENDING ON THEIR IMPACT.

PEST CONTROL METHODS INVOLVE SEVERAL STRATEGIES. CHEMICAL PESTICIDES ARE CATEGORIZED BY THE TARGET ORGANISM: HERBICIDES FOR PLANTS, INSECTICIDES FOR INSECTS, FUNGICIDES FOR FUNGI, AND MOLLUSCICIDES FOR SNAILS AND SLUGS. FARMERS USE THESE CHEMICALS TO ELIMINATE SPECIFIC PESTS AND ENHANCE CROP YIELD.

DAMAGE TO A MAIZE COB CAUSED BY THE CORN EARWORM CATERPILLAR ILLUSTRATES THE IMPACT OF PESTS ON CROP YIELD AND QUALITY. UNDERSTANDING PEST CONTROL METHODS AND SOIL HEALTH IS CRUCIAL FOR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES THAT BENEFIT BOTH THE ENVIRONMENT AND FOOD PRODUCTION.

# ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT

## PROBLEMS WITH PESTICIDES

### MONOCULTURE AND PEST CYCLE
LARGE-SCALE MONOCULTURE FARMING, WHICH INVOLVES CULTIVATING A SINGLE CROP OVER EXTENSIVE AREAS, ENCOURAGES PEST POPULATIONS TO GROW RAPIDLY. THIS PRACTICE SIMPLIFIES HARVESTING BUT ALSO ALLOWS PESTS TO PROLIFERATE UNCHECKED. DURING WINTER, MANY PESTS CAN REMAIN DORMANT IN THE SOIL, EMERGING THE FOLLOWING YEAR TO INFEST CROPS AGAIN.

**CROP ROTATION** IS AN AGRICULTURAL STRATEGY THAT DISRUPTS THIS CYCLE. BY ALTERNATING BETWEEN DIFFERENT CROPS EACH YEAR, FARMERS ENSURE THAT OVER-WINTERING PESTS FIND THEIR PREFERRED HOST UNAVAILABLE. FOR INSTANCE, A THREE-YEAR CROP ROTATION MIGHT INCLUDE POTATOES, WHEAT, AND CLOVER, BREAKING THE PEST LIFE CYCLE EFFECTIVELY.

### THE IMPACT OF PESTICIDES

PESTICIDES, WHILE EFFECTIVE AT CONTROLLING PESTS, POSE SEVERAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES:

1. **RESISTANCE DEVELOPMENT**: THROUGH NATURAL SELECTION, PESTS CAN DEVELOP RESISTANCE TO PESTICIDES. THIS RESISTANCE MAKES EXISTING CHEMICALS LESS EFFECTIVE OVER TIME, COMPELLING FARMERS TO SEEK NEW SOLUTIONS REPEATEDLY.

2. **ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE**: PESTICIDES CAN HARM THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH VARIOUS MECHANISMS:
   - THEY MAY PERSIST IN THE ENVIRONMENT FOR EXTENDED PERIODS.
   - BIOACCUMULATION OCCURS WHEN PESTICIDES ACCUMULATE IN ORGANISMS' TISSUES.
   - BIOMAGNIFICATION LEADS TO INCREASED CONCENTRATION OF PESTICIDES ALONG FOOD CHAINS.
   - THEY OFTEN ELIMINATE BENEFICIAL INSECTS, SUCH AS BEES, ALONGSIDE HARMFUL ONES.

### IDEAL PESTICIDE CHARACTERISTICS
AN IDEAL PESTICIDE SHOULD:
- EFFECTIVELY CONTROL TARGET PESTS WITHOUT CAUSING HARM.
- BE BIODEGRADABLE TO PREVENT TOXIC RESIDUES.
- TARGET SPECIFIC PESTS EXCLUSIVELY.
- BE SAFE FOR TRANSPORTATION, STORAGE, AND APPLICATION.
- AVOID ACCUMULATION IN ORGANISMS.

### CASE STUDY: DDT

**DDT (DICHLORODIPHENYLTRICHLOROETHANE)** SERVES AS A WELL-DOCUMENTED EXAMPLE OF PESTICIDE ISSUES. INVENTED IN 1874 AND RECOGNIZED AS AN INSECTICIDE IN 1939, DDT WAS WIDELY USED DURING WORLD WAR II TO COMBAT MOSQUITOES AND LICE SPREADING MALARIA. ITS POPULARITY PEAKED IN THE 1960S, BUT ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS LED TO ITS BAN IN THE USA IN 1972 AND GLOBALLY IN 2004, THOUGH LIMITED USE REMAINS FOR DISEASE CONTROL.

#### REASONS FOR DDT'S BAN
- **PERSISTENCE**: DDT REMAINS ACTIVE IN THE ENVIRONMENT FOR MANY YEARS. ABOUT HALF OF IT CAN STILL BE PRESENT A DECADE AFTER APPLICATION.
- **RESISTANCE**: BY THE 1950S, MANY INSECTS HAD DEVELOPED RESISTANCE TO DDT DUE TO GENETIC MUTATIONS. THIS RESISTANCE ALLOWED RESISTANT INSECTS TO THRIVE AND PASS THEIR TRAITS TO FUTURE GENERATIONS, ILLUSTRATING NATURAL SELECTION'S ROLE.

### CONCLUSION
PESTICIDES HELP MANAGE PEST POPULATIONS BUT COME WITH ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS AND CAN LEAD TO RESISTANT PESTS. UNDERSTANDING THESE ISSUES IS CRUCIAL FOR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES.

# ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT: HUMAN INFLUENCES ON THE ENVIRONMENT

## THE IMPACT OF INSECTICIDES

INSECTICIDES LIKE DDT ARE WIDELY USED TO CONTROL PEST POPULATIONS BUT HAVE SIGNIFICANT ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES. UNLIKE SELECTIVE METHODS, DDT KILLS NOT ONLY HARMFUL PESTS BUT ALSO BENEFICIAL INSECTS SUCH AS BUTTERFLIES AND BEES, AS WELL AS THEIR NATURAL PREDATORS LIKE WASPS. THIS INDISCRIMINATE USE DISRUPTS FOOD CHAINS AND HARMS ECOSYSTEMS.

### BIOACCUMULATION AND BIOMAGNIFICATION

DDT IS HIGHLY SOLUBLE IN FATS, LEADING TO BIOACCUMULATION WHEN HERBIVORES CONSUME CONTAMINATED PLANTS. THIS PROCESS CONCENTRATES THE INSECTICIDE IN THEIR FATTY TISSUES. WHEN CARNIVORES EAT THESE HERBIVORES, THE DDT CONCENTRATION INCREASES THROUGH BIOMAGNIFICATION. FOR EXAMPLE:

- **PLANKTON**: 0.0000003 MG/KG
- **CRUSTACEANS**: 0.04 MG/KG
- **SMALL FISH**: 0.5 MG/KG
- **LARGE FISH**: 2.0 MG/KG
- **FISH EAGLE**: TOXIC LEVELS

AT THE TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN, DDT CONCENTRATIONS CAN BECOME TOXIC, POTENTIALLY LEADING TO THE DEATH OF TOP CARNIVORES AND DISRUPTING THE ENTIRE FOOD WEB.

!BIOMAGNIFICATION OF DDT IN A FOOD CHAIN

## BIOLOGICAL CONTROL

AN ALTERNATIVE TO CHEMICAL INSECTICIDES IS BIOLOGICAL CONTROL, WHICH USES NATURAL ORGANISMS TO MANAGE PEST POPULATIONS. THIS METHOD AIMS TO REDUCE PEST NUMBERS TO AN ECONOMICALLY ACCEPTABLE LEVEL WITHOUT ERADICATION.

### METHODS OF BIOLOGICAL CONTROL

1. **INTRODUCING NATURAL PREDATORS**: LADYBIRDS CAN BE INTRODUCED TO CONTROL APHID POPULATIONS IN ORANGE GROVES.
2. **INTRODUCING HERBIVORES**: A MOTH FROM SOUTH AMERICA WAS INTRODUCED TO MANAGE THE PRICKLY PEAR CACTUS, WHICH HAD BECOME A SERIOUS WEED IN AUSTRALIA.
3. **INTRODUCING PARASITES**: THE WASP *ENCARSIA* IS USED TO CONTROL WHITEFLY POPULATIONS IN GLASSHOUSE TOMATO CROPS.
4. **PATHOGENIC MICROORGANISMS**: THE MYXOMATOSIS VIRUS WAS RELEASED IN AUSTRALIA TO CONTROL THE RABBIT POPULATION.
5. **STERILE MALES**: INTRODUCING STERILE MALES REDUCES POPULATION NUMBERS BY PREVENTING OFFSPRING PRODUCTION.
6. **USING PHEROMONES**: MALE-ATTRACTING PHEROMONES ARE USED TO TRAP APHIDS IN PLUM CROPS, REDUCING THEIR REPRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL.

!BIOLOGICAL CONTROL

## CONCLUSION

WHILE INSECTICIDES EFFECTIVELY MANAGE PEST POPULATIONS, THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT NECESSITATES EXPLORING ALTERNATIVES LIKE BIOLOGICAL CONTROL. UTILIZING NATURAL PROCESSES CAN ACHIEVE EFFECTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT.

# ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT

## HUMAN INFLUENCES ON THE ENVIRONMENT

### AIR POLLUTION

POLLUTION IS THE CONTAMINATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT BY HARMFUL SUBSTANCES RESULTING FROM HUMAN ACTIVITIES.

HUMAN ACTIONS CONTRIBUTE TO AIR POLLUTION THROUGH THE RELEASE OF VARIOUS GASES, INCLUDING:

- CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2)
- METHANE (CH4)
- CARBON MONOXIDE (CO)
- SULFUR DIOXIDE (SO2)

### CARBON DIOXIDE AND GLOBAL WARMING

THE LEVELS OF CARBON DIOXIDE IN THE ATMOSPHERE HAVE RISEN SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PAST CENTURY. OVER THE LAST 100 YEARS, CO2 CONCENTRATIONS HAVE INCREASED BY NEARLY 30%. THIS INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO:

- THE EXTENSIVE BURNING OF FOSSIL FUELS (COAL, OIL, NATURAL GAS)
- THE USE OF PETROL AND DIESEL IN VEHICLE ENGINES
- DEFORESTATION, PARTICULARLY IN TROPICAL RAINFORESTS, WHICH ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS "THE LUNGS OF THE EARTH" BECAUSE THEY ABSORB LARGE AMOUNTS OF CARBON DIOXIDE AND PRODUCE OXYGEN.

#### SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS IN CARBON DIOXIDE LEVELS

CARBON DIOXIDE LEVELS IN THE ATMOSPHERE EXHIBIT SEASONAL VARIATIONS:

- IN AUTUMN AND WINTER, TREES LOSE THEIR LEAVES, REDUCING PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND INCREASING CO2 RELEASE INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.
- IN SPRING AND SUMMER, NEW LEAVES AND INCREASED SUNLIGHT LEAD TO GREATER PHOTOSYNTHESIS, ABSORBING MORE CARBON DIOXIDE. HOWEVER, DEFORESTATION REDUCES THIS ABSORPTION COMPARED TO NATURAL CONDITIONS.

**FIGURE 15.10** ILLUSTRATES THE CHANGES IN CARBON DIOXIDE LEVELS IN THE ATMOSPHERE FROM 1960 TO 2010.

### THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT

THE INCREASED LEVELS OF CARBON DIOXIDE AND OTHER GREENHOUSE GASES CONTRIBUTE TO GLOBAL WARMING, KNOWN AS THE ENHANCED GREENHOUSE EFFECT.

- THE NORMAL GREENHOUSE EFFECT OCCURS NATURALLY AND IS ESSENTIAL FOR MAINTAINING EARTH'S TEMPERATURE. WITHOUT IT, LIFE AS WE KNOW IT WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE, WITH SURFACE TEMPERATURES APPROXIMATELY 30°C LOWER THAN TODAY.

GREENHOUSE GASES INCLUDE:

- CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2)
- WATER VAPOUR (H2O)
- METHANE (CH4)
- NITROUS OXIDE (N2O)
- CHLOROFLUOROCARBONS (CFCS)

MOST GREENHOUSE GASES OCCUR NATURALLY, BUT SOME, LIKE CFCS, ARE PRODUCED SOLELY BY HUMAN ACTIVITIES.

UNDERSTANDING THESE PROCESSES IS CRUCIAL FOR ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES POSED BY AIR POLLUTION AND CLIMATE CHANGE.

# ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT

## HUMAN INFLUENCES ON THE ENVIRONMENT

### THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT

THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT IS A NATURAL PROCESS THAT WARMS THE EARTH’S SURFACE. IT OCCURS WHEN INCOMING SOLAR RADIATION IS ABSORBED BY THE EARTH, SOME OF WHICH IS RE-EMITTED AS LONGER-WAVELENGTH INFRARED (IR) RADIATION. GREENHOUSE GASES, SUCH AS CARBON DIOXIDE, ABSORB THIS IR RADIATION AND RE-EMIT IT BACK TO THE EARTH, TRAPPING HEAT AND CONTRIBUTING TO GLOBAL WARMING. THIS PROCESS IS ILLUSTRATED IN FIGURE 15.12.

### THE IMPACT OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES

HUMAN ACTIVITIES HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED ATMOSPHERIC GREENHOUSE GAS CONCENTRATIONS, LEADING TO THE ENHANCED GREENHOUSE EFFECT. THIS PHENOMENON CONTRIBUTES TO GLOBAL WARMING BY INCREASING THE EARTH’S SURFACE TEMPERATURE.

#### CONSEQUENCES OF GLOBAL WARMING

A RISE IN TEMPERATURE CAN LEAD TO SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS:

- **MELTING POLAR ICE CAPS**: THIS RESULTS IN RISING SEA LEVELS.
- **CHANGES IN OCEAN CURRENTS**: WARM WATER DISPLACEMENT CAN DISRUPT MARINE ECOSYSTEMS.
- **ALTERED RAINFALL PATTERNS**: INCREASED EVAPORATION FROM THE SEA MAY CAUSE RAINFALL VARIABILITY, LEADING TO DROUGHTS IN SOME REGIONS AND INCREASED RAINFALL IN OTHERS.
- **ECOSYSTEM CHANGES**: SPECIES FACE CHALLENGES ADAPTING TO NEW CONDITIONS, POTENTIALLY LEADING TO EXTINCTIONS IF THEY CANNOT MIGRATE OR ADAPT QUICKLY ENOUGH.
- **AGRICULTURAL SHIFTS**: CLIMATE CHANGES CAN INCREASE PEST POPULATIONS DUE TO ACCELERATED LIFE CYCLES.

### INFRARED RADIATION AND CHLOROFLUOROCARBONS

INFRARED RADIATION PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT. IT IS THE HEAT YOU CAN FEEL FROM SOURCES LIKE ELECTRIC FIRES. ADDITIONALLY, CHLOROFLUOROCARBONS (CFCS) WERE ONCE WIDELY USED IN REFRIGERATORS, SPRAY CANS, AND FOAM PACKAGING. THEIR USE WAS PHASED OUT DUE TO THEIR HARMFUL EFFECTS ON THE OZONE LAYER, WHICH PROTECTS ORGANISMS FROM ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION.

UNDERSTANDING THESE PROCESSES IS ESSENTIAL FOR RECOGNIZING HUMAN IMPACTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE NEED FOR MITIGATION EFFORTS.

# ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT

## HUMAN INFLUENCES ON THE ENVIRONMENT

### METHANE
METHANE (CH₄) IS AN ORGANIC GAS PRODUCED THROUGH FERMENTATION BY MICROORGANISMS. THE PRIMARY SOURCES INCLUDE:

- DECOMPOSITION OF WASTE IN LANDFILL SITES BY MICROORGANISMS.
- FERMENTATION IN THE RUMEN OF CATTLE AND OTHER RUMINANTS, WHERE THEY CAN PRODUCE UP TO 40 DM³ OF METHANE PER ANIMAL PER HOUR.
- FERMENTATION BY BACTERIA IN RICE FIELDS.

METHANE IS A GREENHOUSE GAS WITH EFFECTS SIMILAR TO CARBON DIOXIDE. ALTHOUGH ITS CONCENTRATION IN THE ATMOSPHERE IS LOWER THAN THAT OF CARBON DIOXIDE, EACH MOLECULE HAS A MORE SIGNIFICANT GREENHOUSE EFFECT.

### CARBON MONOXIDE
CARBON MONOXIDE (CO) FORMS WHEN SUBSTANCES CONTAINING CARBON ARE BURNED IN A LIMITED SUPPLY OF OXYGEN. THIS OCCURS NOTABLY DURING THE COMBUSTION OF PETROL AND DIESEL IN VEHICLE ENGINES, LEADING TO SUBSTANTIAL CO LEVELS IN EXHAUST GASES.

**KEY POINT:** CARBON MONOXIDE IS A DANGEROUS POLLUTANT AS IT IS COLORLESS, ODORLESS, AND TASTELESS. IT BINDS MORE STRONGLY WITH HAEMOGLOBIN THAN OXYGEN. PROLONGED INHALATION CAN LEAD TO HAEMOGLOBIN BEING UNABLE TO BIND WITH OXYGEN, RESULTING IN LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND POTENTIALLY FATAL HYPOXIA DUE TO INSUFFICIENT OXYGEN REACHING VITAL ORGANS SUCH AS THE HEART AND BRAIN.

### SULFUR DIOXIDE
SULFUR DIOXIDE (SO₂) IS AN AIR POLLUTANT PRODUCED BY THE COMBUSTION OF FOSSIL FUELS. IT COMBINES WITH WATER DROPLETS IN THE AIR AND CAN TRAVEL HUNDREDS OF MILES BEFORE PRECIPITATING AS ACID RAIN.

- **NORMAL RAIN:** TYPICALLY HAS A PH OF ABOUT 5.5, SLIGHTLY ACIDIC DUE TO DISSOLVED CARBON DIOXIDE.
- **ACID RAIN FORMATION:** THE DISSOLUTION OF SULFUR DIOXIDE AND NITROGEN OXIDES IN RAINWATER FORMS A MIXTURE OF ACIDS, INCLUDING SULFURIC AND NITRIC ACIDS, SIGNIFICANTLY LOWERING THE PH.

#### NATURAL VS. HUMAN CAUSES OF ACID RAIN
- **NATURAL CAUSES:**
  - VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS
  - LIGHTNING
  - WATER VAPOR FROM CLOUDS

- **HUMAN CAUSES:**
  - BURNING FOSSIL FUELS
  - EMISSION OF SULFUR DIOXIDE AND NITROGEN OXIDES

**EFFECTS OF ACID RAIN:**
- ACIDIFICATION OF LAKES, LEADING TO THE DEATH OF BACTERIA, ALGAE, FISH, AND AMPHIBIAN EGGS, DISRUPTING ECOSYSTEMS.
- ACIDIFICATION OF SOIL, CAUSING LEACHING OF IONS INTO LAKES THAT CAN BE TOXIC TO FISH AND HINDER TREE GROWTH DUE TO REDUCED MINERAL ABSORPTION.

### LICHENS AS INDICATORS
LICHENS, SMALL MOSS-LIKE ORGANISMS, INDICATE AIR QUALITY. SOME LICHENS ARE MORE TOLERANT OF SULFUR DIOXIDE THAN OTHERS. IN SOME COUNTRIES, PATTERNS OF LICHEN GROWTH ARE USED TO ASSESS ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH.

---

THIS OVERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS HUMAN INFLUENCES ON THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND POLLUTANTS, DETAILING THEIR SOURCES, EFFECTS, AND IMPLICATIONS FOR ECOSYSTEMS.

# ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT

## HUMAN INFLUENCES ON THE ENVIRONMENT

### POLLUTION MONITORING WITH LICHENS

LICHENS SERVE AS INDICATOR SPECIES FOR MONITORING SULFUR DIOXIDE LEVELS DUE TO THEIR SENSITIVITY TO POLLUTION. DIFFERENT LICHEN TYPES INDICATE VARYING POLLUTION LEVELS:

- ORANGE CRUSTY LICHENS (*XANTHORIA* SPP.) ARE FOUND IN AREAS WITH HIGH SULFUR DIOXIDE LEVELS.
- LEAFY LICHENS ON STONE SURFACES INDICATE MODERATE POLLUTION.
- SHRUBBY LICHENS ON TREES SUGGEST VERY LOW POLLUTION LEVELS.
- USNEA-TYPE LICHENS ON TREES SIGNIFY CLEAN AIR WITH MINIMAL POLLUTION.

THE MAP IN FIGURE 15.14 ILLUSTRATES THESE ZONES ACROSS BRITAIN, REFLECTING VARYING SULFUR DIOXIDE CONCENTRATIONS.

### WATER POLLUTION

FRESHWATER IS POLLUTED PRIMARILY BY SEWAGE AND MINERALS FROM FERTILIZERS.

#### SEWAGE POLLUTION

SEWAGE CONSISTS OF WET WASTE FROM HOUSEHOLDS, FACTORIES, AND FARMS. IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, SEWAGE TREATMENT SEPARATES INDUSTRIAL AND AGRICULTURAL WASTE FROM HOUSEHOLD WASTE. HOUSEHOLD SEWAGE INCLUDES WASTEWATER FROM KITCHENS AND BATHROOMS, CONTAINING HUMAN WASTE, DISSOLVED ORGANIC, AND INORGANIC CHEMICALS LIKE SOAPS AND DETERGENTS.

UNTREATED SEWAGE DISCHARGE INTO WATERWAYS LEADS TO TWO MAIN ISSUES:

1. **OXYGEN DEPLETION**: AEROBIC BACTERIA CONSUME OXYGEN WHILE BREAKING DOWN ORGANIC MATERIALS, REDUCING OXYGEN LEVELS AND POTENTIALLY KILLING AQUATIC ORGANISMS.
2. **HEALTH RISKS**: UNTREATED SEWAGE CONTAINS PATHOGENIC BACTERIA, POSING HEALTH HAZARDS.

THESE IMPACTS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING WATER RESOURCES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH.

# ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT

## HUMAN INFLUENCES ON THE ENVIRONMENT

### SEWAGE POLLUTION

WHEN UNTREATED SEWAGE ENTERS A RIVER, IT REDUCES WATER QUALITY BY LOWERING OXYGEN LEVELS AS MICROORGANISMS DECOMPOSE ORGANIC MATTER. ONLY ANAEROBIC BACTERIA THRIVE IN THESE CONDITIONS. DOWNSTREAM, MIXING WITH CLEANER WATER RESTORES OXYGEN, ALLOWING MORE SPECIES TO SURVIVE.

THE AIM OF SEWAGE TREATMENT IS TO REMOVE SOLIDS, SUSPENDED MATTER, AND PATHOGENS, ENABLING CLEANER DISCHARGE INTO WATERWAYS.

### MONITORING POLLUTION

SIMILAR TO SULFUR DIOXIDE AIR POLLUTION MONITORING, POLLUTION FROM ORGANIC MATERIAL CAN BE TRACKED USING INDICATOR SPECIES. SOME ANIMALS THRIVE ONLY IN CLEAN WATER, WHILE OTHERS TOLERATE POLLUTION.

### EUTROPHICATION

EUTROPHICATION OCCURS WHEN EXCESSIVE NUTRIENTS LIKE NITRATES OR PHOSPHATES ENTER WATER BODIES, PRIMARILY FROM SEWAGE OR FERTILIZERS. THIS PROCESS HARMS AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS BY ALTERING NUTRIENT CYCLES AND DISRUPTING BIODIVERSITY.

# ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT

## HUMAN INFLUENCES ON THE ENVIRONMENT

### EUTROPHICATION

EUTROPHICATION IS A SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE OFTEN CAUSED BY THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL FERTILIZERS IN AGRICULTURE. WHEN STREAMS AND RIVERS FLOW THROUGH AGRICULTURAL LAND TREATED WITH THESE FERTILIZERS, THEY CAN ACCUMULATE HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF NITRATES AND PHOSPHATES.

#### KEY PROCESSES:
- **LEACHING**: NITRATE, HIGHLY SOLUBLE IN WATER, WASHES OUT OF SOIL DURING RAINFALL.
- **SURFACE RUNOFF**: PHOSPHATE, LESS SOLUBLE, ENTERS WATERWAYS THROUGH SURFACE RUN-OFF.

### EFFECTS OF EUTROPHICATION

EXCESS MINERAL IONS FROM FERTILIZERS STIMULATE AQUATIC PLANT GROWTH, LEADING TO RAPID ALGAE GROWTH KNOWN AS AN ALGAL BLOOM. THIS CREATES A THICK SCUM ON WATER SURFACES, AS SHOWN IN FIGURE 15.17.

!FIGURE 15.17 AN ALGAL BLOOM CAUSED BY FERTILIZER

THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS FOLLOWING EUTROPHICATION IS AS FOLLOWS:
1. **INCREASE IN MINERAL IONS**: EXCESS NUTRIENTS ENTER WATERWAYS.
2. **ALGAL BLOOM**: ALGAE RAPIDLY GROW DUE TO AVAILABLE NUTRIENTS.
3. **DEATH OF ALGAE**: DEAD ALGAE ARE DECOMPOSED BY AEROBIC BACTERIA, CONSUMING OXYGEN.
4. **OXYGEN DEPLETION**: REDUCED OXYGEN LEVELS CAN LEAD TO FISH DEATHS AND ANOXIC CONDITIONS.
5. **IMPACT ON AQUATIC LIFE**: LOW OXYGEN LEVELS RESULT IN MORTALITY OF AQUATIC ANIMALS; ANAEROBIC BACTERIA PRODUCE FOUL ODORS.

### PREVENTION OF EUTROPHICATION

RAPID EUTROPHICATION IS LESS LIKELY WHEN FARMERS USE ORGANIC FERTILIZERS, SUCH AS MANURE. ORGANIC NITROGEN COMPOUNDS ARE LESS SOLUBLE, REDUCING NUTRIENT OVERLOAD RISK IN WATERWAYS.

### SKILLS: ANALYSIS
THE GRAPH OF CO2 LEVELS AT MAUNA LOA SHOWS A STEADY INCREASE OVER THE YEARS, INDICATING HUMAN ACTIVITIES' GROWING IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT.  

EACH YEAR'S DATA REVEALS PEAKS AND TROUGHS DUE TO NATURAL VARIABILITY, SUCH AS SEASONAL CHANGES IN PLANT RESPIRATION AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS, WHICH INFLUENCE ATMOSPHERIC CO2 LEVELS.

---

## GRAPH DATA
YEARLY CO2 LEVELS:  
- 1960: 310 PPM  
- 1965: 320 PPM  
- 1970: 330 PPM  
- 1975: 340 PPM  
- 1980: 350 PPM  
- 1985: 360 PPM  
- 1990: 370 PPM  

THE DATA SHOWS A CONSISTENT RISE IN ATMOSPHERIC CO2 LEVELS, REFLECTING HUMAN-INDUCED CHANGES.

# ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT: HUMAN EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT

## THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT

THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT IS A NATURAL PROCESS THAT CONTRIBUTES TO EARTH'S WARMTH. IT WORKS AS FOLLOWS:

1. **SHORT WAVE RADIATION FROM THE SUN**: THE SUN EMITS ENERGY IN THE FORM OF SHORT WAVE RADIATION.
2. **ABSORPTION BY THE EARTH**: THIS RADIATION IS ABSORBED, WARMING THE PLANET.
3. **RE-EMISSION AS LONG WAVE RADIATION**: THE EARTH RE-EMITS THIS ENERGY AS LONG WAVE RADIATION.
4. **GREENHOUSE GASES**: SOME LONG WAVE RADIATION ESCAPES INTO SPACE, BUT A PORTION IS TRAPPED BY GREENHOUSE GASES IN THE ATMOSPHERE, WHICH RE-EMIT IT BACK TO EARTH, ENHANCING THE WARMING EFFECT.

## ALGAL BLOOMS AND FERTILIZER USE

### OBSERVATIONS:
WHEN NITRATE FERTILIZER WAS APPLIED TO FIELD 1, AN ALGAL BLOOM OCCURRED IN THE POND. THIS DID NOT HAPPEN WHEN FERTILIZER WAS APPLIED TO FIELD 2.

### EXPLANATION:
THE FERTILIZER INCREASED WATER NUTRIENTS, PARTICULARLY NITROGEN, WHICH PROMOTES ALGAL GROWTH. THE ABSENCE OF A BLOOM IN FIELD 2 MAY BE DUE TO INSUFFICIENT RUNOFF OR ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS LIMITING GROWTH.

### ADDITIONAL FACTOR:
ALGAL BLOOMS ARE MORE PRONOUNCED IN HOT WEATHER BECAUSE HIGHER TEMPERATURES ACCELERATE GROWTH AND REPRODUCTION.

## IMPACT OF SEWAGE DISCHARGE

UNTREATED SEWAGE DISCHARGE INTO RIVERS CAN SEVERELY AFFECT AQUATIC LIFE BY INTRODUCING NUTRIENTS LIKE NITROGEN AND PHOSPHORUS. THESE NUTRIENTS CAUSE ALGAL BLOOMS, LEADING TO OXYGEN DEPLETION DURING DECOMPOSITION, SUFFOCATING FISH AND OTHER ORGANISMS.

## FARMING PRACTICES: PESTICIDES AND FERTILIZERS

FARMERS USE PESTICIDES AND FERTILIZERS TO BOOST CROP YIELDS, WHILE ORGANIC FARMERS EMPLOY NATURAL METHODS TO MAINTAIN SOIL FERTILITY AND PEST CONTROL WITHOUT SYNTHETIC CHEMICALS.

### BENEFITS OF CHEMICAL USE:
PESTICIDES CONTROL PESTS THAT DAMAGE CROPS, AND FERTILIZERS PROVIDE ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS, ENHANCING PLANT PRODUCTIVITY.

### ORGANIC METHODS:
ORGANIC FARMING USES CROP ROTATION, COVER CROPS, COMPOST, AND NATURAL PEST CONTROLS LIKE BENEFICIAL INSECTS TO SUSTAIN SOIL HEALTH AND MANAGE PESTS WITHOUT SYNTHETIC CHEMICALS.

## UNIT QUESTIONS

### 1. FERTILISER AND WHEAT YIELD

A FARMER TESTED DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF NITRATE FERTILISER ON HIS WHEAT CROP TO ASSESS ITS IMPACT ON YIELD. THE DATA REVEALED THAT INCREASING FERTILISER USAGE INITIALLY BOOSTED WHEAT PRODUCTION, BUT AFTER A CERTAIN THRESHOLD, PRODUCTIVITY BEGAN TO DECLINE. FOR INSTANCE, WHILE 50 KG OF FERTILISER YIELDED 15 TONNES PER HECTARE, APPLYING 250 KG RESULTED IN ONLY 30 TONNES, INDICATING POTENTIAL DIMINISHING RETURNS.

THE TABLE ILLUSTRATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FERTILISER APPLICATION AND WHEAT YIELD, SHOWING THAT HIGHER DOSES BEYOND 200 KG PER HECTARE DID NOT PROPORTIONALLY INCREASE OUTPUT. THIS SUGGESTS THAT OPTIMAL FERTILISER USE LIES SOMEWHERE BELOW THIS THRESHOLD. ADDITIONALLY, EXCESSIVE NITRATE USAGE CAN HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES, AS IT MAY LEACH INTO RIVERS, LEADING TO EUTROPHICATION AND DISRUPTING AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS BY ENCOURAGING EXCESSIVE PLANT GROWTH, WHICH CAN SMOTHER OTHER ORGANISMS.

### 2. INSECTICIDES AND PEST CONTROL

FARMERS EMPLOY INSECTICIDES TO MANAGE PEST POPULATIONS IN CROPS LIKE POTATOES. A TRIAL TESTED A NEW INSECTICIDE OVER THREE YEARS, WITH VARYING RESULTS EACH YEAR. THE WEAKEST CONCENTRATION SHOWED REDUCED EFFECTIVENESS OVER TIME, FROM 95% IN YEAR 1 TO 18% IN YEAR 3. SIMILARLY, THE STRONGEST CONCENTRATION ALSO SAW ITS EFFICACY DROP FROM 99% TO 47% BY YEAR 3.

THIS DECLINE IN EFFECTIVENESS MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO FACTORS SUCH AS PEST RESISTANCE OR ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THAT REDUCE THE INSECTICIDE'S POTENCY OVER TIME. FARMERS MIGHT PREFER INTERMEDIATE CONCENTRATIONS FOR A BALANCE BETWEEN EFFECTIVENESS AND ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY, CONSIDERING BOTH YIELD PROTECTION AND COST.

### SKILLS DEVELOPMENT

- **INTERPRETATION:** ANALYZING DATA TO UNDERSTAND TRENDS AND RELATIONSHIPS.
- **PROBLEM SOLVING:** APPLYING KNOWLEDGE TO REAL-WORLD AGRICULTURAL SCENARIOS.
- **REASONING:** JUSTIFYING DECISIONS BASED ON LOGICAL EXPLANATIONS.
- **REASSURING:** PROVIDING CLEAR, EVIDENCE-BASED ADVICE.

# ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT

## UNIT QUESTIONS

### BIOACCUMULATION
WHAT IS BIOACCUMULATION?  
BIOACCUMULATION REFERS TO THE PROCESS BY WHICH SUBSTANCES, SUCH AS PESTICIDES OR HEAVY METALS, ACCUMULATE IN AN ORGANISM OVER TIME, OFTEN AT HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS THAN IN THE SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT.  

AN EXAMPLE OF BIOACCUMULATION IS THE ACCUMULATION OF THE INSECTICIDE DDT IN FISH. AS SMALLER ORGANISMS INGEST DDT, IT BUILDS UP IN THEIR BODIES. WHEN LARGER FISH EAT THESE SMALLER FISH, THE CONCENTRATION OF DDT INCREASES FURTHER, LEADING TO HARMFUL EFFECTS ON THE LARGER FISH AND THE ANIMALS THAT CONSUME THEM.  

IT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THAT THERE IS NO BIOACCUMULATION OF THIS INSECTICIDE BECAUSE IT CAN LEAD TO TOXIC EFFECTS ON WILDLIFE AND DISRUPT ENTIRE ECOSYSTEMS.

### THE CARBON CYCLE
WHAT IS THE ROLE OF PLANTS IN THE CARBON CYCLE?  
PLANTS PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN THE CARBON CYCLE BY ABSORBING CARBON DIOXIDE DURING PHOTOSYNTHESIS, WHICH HELPS REGULATE ATMOSPHERIC CARBON LEVELS AND PROVIDES ENERGY FOR OTHER ORGANISMS.  

WHICH HUMAN ACTIVITIES AFFECT THE CARBON CYCLE?  
TWO HUMAN ACTIVITIES THAT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE CARBON CYCLE ARE DEFORESTATION AND BURNING FOSSIL FUELS. DEFORESTATION REDUCES THE NUMBER OF TREES AVAILABLE TO ABSORB CARBON DIOXIDE, WHILE BURNING FOSSIL FUELS RELEASES LARGE AMOUNTS OF CARBON DIOXIDE INTO THE ATMOSPHERE, CONTRIBUTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE.

### DECOMPOSER ACTIVITY
WHAT DOES THE GRAPH SHOW ABOUT DECOMPOSER ACTIVITY?  
THE GRAPH SHOWS THE ACTIVITY OF DECOMPOSERS ACTING ON THE BODIES OF DEAD ANIMALS UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS.  

HOW WAS CARBON DIOXIDE PRODUCTION USED TO MEASURE DECOMPOSER ACTIVITY?  
CARBON DIOXIDE PRODUCTION WAS USED AS A MEASURE OF DECOMPOSER ACTIVITY BECAUSE IT INDICATES THE RATE AT WHICH DECOMPOSERS ARE BREAKING DOWN ORGANIC MATTER.  

WHAT CAUSED CHANGES IN DECOMPOSER ACTIVITY?  
WHEN INSECTS WERE ALLOWED ACCESS TO THE DEAD BODIES, DECOMPOSER ACTIVITY INCREASED. THIS IS LIKELY BECAUSE INSECTS HELP BREAK DOWN THE ORGANIC MATERIAL, MAKING IT MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR DECOMPOSERS.  

WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO CURVES?  
TWO DIFFERENCES INCLUDE A HIGHER RATE OF DECOMPOSITION AND A QUICKER TIME TO PEAK ACTIVITY IN CURVE 1 COMPARED TO CURVE 2. THE PRESENCE OF INSECTS ACCELERATES THE BREAKDOWN OF ORGANIC MATTER, LEADING TO INCREASED DECOMPOSER ACTIVITY.

### COMPETITION IN ECOSYSTEMS
HOW DOES COMPETITION OCCUR IN ECOSYSTEMS?  
IN NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS, COMPETITION OCCURS BOTH WITHIN THE SAME SPECIES AND BETWEEN DIFFERENT SPECIES. THIS COMPETITION HELPS CONTROL POPULATION GROWTH BY LIMITING RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS.  

WHAT RESOURCES DO CROP PLANTS AND WEEDS COMPETE FOR?  
THEY MAY COMPETE FOR LIGHT AND NUTRIENTS. WITHOUT SUFFICIENT LIGHT, CROP YIELDS CAN DECREASE, WHILE COMPETITION FOR NUTRIENTS CAN STUNT CROP DEVELOPMENT.  

WHEN SHOULD HERBICIDES BE APPLIED TO MINIMIZE COMPETITION?  
FARMERS PREFER TO SPRAY HERBICIDES EARLY IN THE GROWING SEASON TO PREVENT WEEDS FROM COMPETING WITH CROPS FOR RESOURCES, WHICH CAN LEAD TO HIGHER CROP YIELDS.

WHEN THE PARASITE IS ABSENT, SPECIES B EXHIBITS GREATER SUCCESS AS ITS POPULATION INCREASES SIGNIFICANTLY OVER TIME, SURPASSING THAT OF SPECIES A BY DAY 900. WHEN THE PARASITE IS PRESENT, BOTH SPECIES ARE AFFECTED, BUT SPECIES A'S POPULATION DROPS DRASTICALLY, ALLOWING SPECIES B TO MAINTAIN A HIGHER COUNT AND DOMINATE.

**ANSWER:**
SPECIES B IS MORE SUCCESSFUL WHEN THE PARASITE IS ABSENT BECAUSE IT EXHIBITS A STEADY INCREASE IN POPULATION, OUTCOMPETING SPECIES A WHICH DECLINES OVER TIME. WHEN THE PARASITE IS PRESENT, BOTH SPECIES ARE IMPACTED, WITH SPECIES A'S POPULATION COLLAPSING SIGNIFICANTLY, ENABLING SPECIES B TO THRIVE WITHOUT COMPETITION FROM SPECIES A.

# ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT

## RUST FUNGI INFECTION IN CROPS

RUST FUNGI ARE PARASITIC ORGANISMS THAT INFECT CROP PLANTS, LEADING TO SIGNIFICANT PRODUCTIVITY LOSSES. TWO PRIMARY MECHANISMS CONTRIBUTE TO THIS REDUCTION IN YIELD:

1. **PHOTOSYNTHESIS IMPAIRMENT**: THE FUNGI BLOCK SUNLIGHT FROM REACHING PLANT LEAVES, THEREBY DECREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND REDUCING ENERGY PRODUCTION.
2. **NUTRIENT DRAIN**: RUST FUNGI EXTRACT NUTRIENTS FROM THEIR HOST PLANTS, WEAKENING THE PLANTS AND REDUCING THEIR OVERALL HEALTH AND PRODUCTIVITY.

## FUNGICIDE EXPERIMENT

TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF FUNGICIDES IN CONTROLLING RUST INFECTIONS, AN EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED ON A WHEAT FIELD DIVIDED INTO TWO PLOTS. ONE PLOT WAS SPRAYED WITH A FUNGICIDE AT THE FIRST SIGNS OF INFECTION, WHILE THE OTHER REMAINED UNTREATED. THE RELATIVE LEVELS OF INFECTION WERE MONITORED OVER 50 DAYS.

THE DATA COLLECTED OVER THIS PERIOD REVEALED INCREASING INFECTION RATES IN BOTH TREATED AND UNTREATED PLOTS, THOUGH THE UNTREATED PLOT SHOWED HIGHER INFECTION LEVELS THROUGHOUT THE OBSERVATION PERIOD.

## ANALYSIS OF INFECTION TRENDS

OVER THE COURSE OF 50 DAYS, THE UNTREATED PLOT EXHIBITED CONSISTENTLY HIGHER INFECTION LEVELS COMPARED TO THE SPRAYED PLOT. BY DAY 24, THE UNTREATED PLOT HAD AN INFECTION RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 40%, WHILE THE SPRAYED PLOT SHOWED SIGNS OF INFECTION AT ABOUT 25%.

## IMPORTANCE OF CONTROL GROUPS

A CONTROL GROUP IS ESSENTIAL IN EXPERIMENTAL SETUPS AS IT PROVIDES A BASELINE FOR COMPARISON. IT HELPS RESEARCHERS DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TREATMENTS BY IDENTIFYING OUTCOMES IN UNTREATED SUBJECTS.

IN THIS EXPERIMENT, THE UNTREATED PLOT SERVED AS THE CONTROL GROUP, ALLOWING SCIENTISTS TO MEASURE THE IMPACT OF THE FUNGICIDE ON INFECTION LEVELS.

## LONG-TERM INFECTION TRENDS

FIVE YEARS AFTER THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION, THE RELATIVE INFECTION RATES SHOWED A TREND TOWARDS HIGHER LEVELS IN BOTH TREATED AND UNTREATED PLOTS. BY DAY 30, THE UNTREATED PLOT HAD AN INFECTION RATE OF 46%, WHILE THE SPRAYED PLOT SHOWED 38%. THIS INCREASE SUGGESTS THAT THE FUNGICIDE'S EFFECTIVENESS MAY DIMINISH OVER TIME OR THAT ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO INFECTION LEVELS.

## SKILL DEVELOPMENT

### INTERPRETATION
UNDERSTANDING HOW RUST FUNGI INFECT PLANTS AND REDUCE YIELD IS CRUCIAL FOR AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES. THE TWO MECHANISMS IDENTIFIED—PHOTOSYNTHESIS IMPAIRMENT AND NUTRIENT DRAIN—ARE KEY FACTORS IN CROP PRODUCTIVITY LOSS.

### ANALYSIS
THE DATA FROM THE EXPERIMENT CLEARLY SHOWS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FUNGICIDE OVER TIME. BY PLOTTING THIS INFORMATION, STUDENTS CAN VISUALIZE INFECTION TRENDS AND COMPARE OUTCOMES BETWEEN TREATED AND UNTREATED PLOTS.

### EVALUATION
THE NECESSITY OF A CONTROL GROUP IS EVIDENT IN THIS EXPERIMENT. IT PROVIDES A REFERENCE POINT FOR ASSESSING TREATMENT EFFECTS, ENSURING THAT RESULTS ARE NOT ATTRIBUTED TO EXTERNAL FACTORS OR NATURAL VARIABILITY.

THIS STRUCTURED APPROACH ENSURES CLARITY AND FACTUAL ACCURACY, GUIDING STUDENTS THROUGH THE ECOLOGICAL CONCEPTS INVOLVED IN PLANT-PATHOGEN INTERACTIONS AND EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN.

# BIOLOGY UNIT 5: VARIATION AND SELECTION

## OVERVIEW OF DNA, GENES, AND CELL DIVISION

THE GENETIC CODE IS STORED IN A MOLECULE WITHIN THE NUCLEUS OF CELLS CALLED **DNA** (DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID). THIS MOLECULE CONTAINS THE HEREDITARY INFORMATION NECESSARY FOR LIFE. DNA IS ORGANIZED INTO SEGMENTS KNOWN AS **GENES**, EACH RESPONSIBLE FOR CODING SPECIFIC TRAITS.

## THE DISCOVERY OF DNA

IN **1953**, THE STRUCTURE OF DNA WAS FIRST UNDERSTOOD, MARKING THE FOUNDATION OF A NEW FIELD CALLED **MOLECULAR BIOLOGY**. THIS DISCIPLINE EXAMINES HOW GENETIC CODE INFLUENCES CELLULAR FUNCTIONS AND IS CLOSELY LINKED WITH **GENETICS**, WHICH STUDIES THE VISIBLE EFFECTS OF GENES ON ORGANISMS.

## KEY CONCEPTS

### DNA AND GENETIC CODE
DNA SERVES AS THE PRIMARY REPOSITORY FOR THE GENETIC CODE, DETERMINING AN ORGANISM'S CHARACTERISTICS. GENES, SPECIFIC SEGMENTS OF DNA, CODE FOR PARTICULAR TRAITS.

### CELL DIVISION
WHEN CELLS DIVIDE, DNA IS PASSED FROM ONE CELL TO ANOTHER, ENSURING THE MAINTENANCE OF GENETIC INFORMATION ACROSS GENERATIONS.

### GENETICS
THIS UNIT EXPLORES HOW DNA MANIFESTS IN ORGANISMS, INFLUENCING THEIR TRAITS AND BEHAVIORS.

### NATURAL SELECTION AND EVOLUTION
CHAPTER 19 DISCUSSES **DARWIN'S THEORY OF EVOLUTION BY NATURAL SELECTION**, A CORNERSTONE OF BIOLOGY. ADDITIONALLY, IT EXAMINES **SELECTIVE BREEDING**, ILLUSTRATING HUMAN INFLUENCE ON ORGANISMAL TRAITS THROUGH SELECTIVE REPRODUCTION.

## CONCLUSION

THIS UNIT PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO HOW DNA, GENES, AND CELL DIVISION CONTRIBUTE TO BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY. IT CONNECTS THESE CONCEPTS WITH BROADER THEMES IN BIOLOGY, SUCH AS EVOLUTION AND NATURAL SELECTION.
