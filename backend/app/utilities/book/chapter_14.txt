# BIOLOGY UNIT 4: ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT

## INTRODUCTION TO ECOLOGY
ECOLOGY IS THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ORGANISMS AND THEIR SURROUNDINGS. IT EXAMINES HOW LIVING THINGS INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH NON-LIVING PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTS.

## COMPONENTS OF ECOSYSTEMS
THIS UNIT EXPLORES THE COMPONENTS OF ECOSYSTEMS, INCLUDING PRODUCERS, CONSUMERS, AND DECOMPOSERS, AS WELL AS THE INTERACTIONS THAT SUSTAIN THESE ELEMENTS. UNDERSTANDING THESE DYNAMICS IS ESSENTIAL FOR GRASPING ECOLOGICAL BALANCE AND ORGANISMIC ROLES WITHIN THEIR ENVIRONMENTS.

## HUMAN INFLUENCES ON ECOSYSTEMS
HUMAN ACTIVITIES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT GLOBAL ECOSYSTEMS. AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES AND INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION DISRUPT ENVIRONMENTAL EQUILIBRIUM, LEADING TO ECOLOGICAL DAMAGE. THIS SECTION EXAMINES THESE IMPACTS AND EXPLORES POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS TO MITIGATE THEIR EFFECTS.

BY STUDYING THESE TOPICS, STUDENTS GAIN A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF ECOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES AND THE CHALLENGES POSED BY HUMAN ACTIVITIES TO NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS.

AN ECOSYSTEM IS A DISTINCT, SELF-SUSTAINING SYSTEM WHERE ORGANISMS INTERACT WITH THEIR ENVIRONMENT. ECOSYSTEMS CAN RANGE IN SIZE FROM SMALL PONDS TO LARGE MANGROVE SWAMPS OR FORESTS. THIS CHAPTER EXPLORES THESE SYSTEMS AND THE INTERACTIONS WITHIN THEM.

THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS CHAPTER ARE TO UNDERSTAND KEY TERMS SUCH AS ECOSYSTEM, HABITAT, POPULATION, AND COMMUNITY; ANALYZE ENERGY TRANSFER ALONG FOOD CHAINS; STUDY POPULATION DYNAMICS USING QUADRATS; EXAMINE FACTORS AFFECTING POPULATION SIZE; AND EXPLORE TROPHIC LEVELS AND FOOD RELATIONSHIPS, INCLUDING PYRAMIDS OF NUMBER, BIOMASS, AND ENERGY TRANSFER.

EXAMPLES OF ECOSYSTEMS INCLUDE PONDS AND MANGROVE SWAMPS. A POND EXEMPLIFIES A SMALL-SCALE ECOSYSTEM WITH VARIOUS INTERACTIONS AMONG AQUATIC ORGANISMS, WHILE A MANGROVE SWAMP ILLUSTRATES LARGER, MORE COMPLEX SYSTEMS INVOLVING DIFFERENT ORGANISMS AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS.

THIS CHAPTER PROVIDES DETAILED INSIGHTS INTO ECOSYSTEMS, FOCUSING ON THEIR STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS WITHOUT SUMMARIZING OR CONCLUDING STATEMENTS.

# ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT: ECOSYSTEMS

## THE COMPONENTS OF ECOSYSTEMS

ECOSYSTEMS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR SIZE, CONSIST OF FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENTS THAT INTERACT TO MAINTAIN BALANCE.

### KEY COMPONENTS:
- **PRODUCERS**: PLANTS THAT USE PHOTOSYNTHESIS TO CREATE ENERGY FOR THEMSELVES AND OTHER ORGANISMS.
- **CONSUMERS**: ANIMALS THAT EAT PLANTS OR OTHER ANIMALS, FORMING A FOOD CHAIN.
- **DECOMPOSERS**: FUNGI AND BACTERIA THAT BREAK DOWN DEAD MATERIAL, RECYCLING NUTRIENTS BACK INTO THE ECOSYSTEM.

### PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT INCLUDES NON-BIOLOGICAL ELEMENTS SUCH AS WATER, SOIL, AND AIR, WHICH PROVIDE THE FOUNDATION FOR ALL ECOSYSTEMS.

### BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC COMPONENTS
- **BIOTIC COMPONENTS**: LIVING PARTS OF AN ECOSYSTEM, INCLUDING ALL ORGANISMS.
- **ABIOTIC COMPONENTS**: NON-LIVING COMPONENTS LIKE WATER, SOIL, AND AIR THAT INFLUENCE THE ECOSYSTEM'S FUNCTIONING.

### HABITATS
A HABITAT IS THE SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENT WHERE AN ORGANISM LIVES. IN A POND ECOSYSTEM:
- OPEN WATER SUPPORTS PLANKTON AND FLOATING PLANTS.
- MUD AT THE BOTTOM SHELTERS SNAILS AND OTHER ORGANISMS.
- SURFACE AREAS HOST ROOTED PLANTS INTERACTING WITH BOTH SOIL AND AIR.

### POPULATIONS AND COMMUNITIES
- **POPULATION**: ALL INDIVIDUALS OF A SPECIES IN A SPECIFIC LOCATION, SUCH AS TADPOLES IN A POND.
- **COMMUNITY**: THE COLLECTIVE OF ALL POPULATIONS WITHIN AN ECOSYSTEM, REPRESENTING THE DIVERSITY OF LIFE.

## EXAMPLE: POND ECOSYSTEM

IN A POND, VARIOUS ORGANISMS THRIVE IN DISTINCT HABITATS:
- PLANKTON FLOATS IN OPEN WATER.
- FLOATING PLANTS ADAPT TO WATER AND AIR INTERFACES.
- SNAILS INHABIT SURFACES LIKE SOIL AND PLANTS.

!FIGURE 14.3: A POND ECOSYSTEM

## SAMPLING TECHNIQUES

ECOLOGISTS USE SAMPLING METHODS TO ESTIMATE ORGANISM COUNTS WITHOUT EXHAUSTIVE COUNTING. ONE TECHNIQUE IS THE QUADRAT METHOD FOR STUDYING PLANTS OR IMMOBILE ANIMALS.

### QUADRAT METHOD
- A QUADRAT IS A SQUARE USED TO COUNT ORGANISMS IN SPECIFIC AREAS.
- SIZE VARIES BASED ON THE ORGANISMS STUDIED, SUCH AS 0.5 METERS FOR PLANT SAMPLES IN FIELDS.

## COMMON MISCONCEPTION

QUADRANTS ARE OFTEN CONFUSED WITH QUADRATS. A QUADRANT IS A QUARTER-CIRCLE, NOT A SQUARE. UNDERSTANDING THIS DISTINCTION IS CRUCIAL FOR ACCURATE ECOLOGICAL STUDIES.

!FIGURE 14.4: EXAMPLE OF A QUADRAT

BY EXAMINING THESE COMPONENTS AND METHODS, WE GAIN INSIGHT INTO THE COMPLEXITY AND INTERDEPENDENCE OF ECOSYSTEMS.

# ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT: ECOSYSTEMS

## KEY POINT
WHEN SAMPLING ECOSYSTEMS, RANDOM METHODS ARE CRUCIAL TO AVOID BIAS. THE "THROWING" METHOD FOR PLACING QUADRATS CAN APPEAR RANDOM BUT MAY LEAD TO SKEWED RESULTS. FOR EXAMPLE, THROWING A QUADRAT OVER ONE'S SHOULDER CAN MAKE ITS LANDING POSITION DEPENDENT ON THE THROW'S FORCE AND STARTING POINT, WHICH ISN'T TRULY RANDOM.

## IMPORTANCE OF RANDOM SAMPLING
TO OBTAIN REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLES, IT'S ESSENTIAL TO AVOID CONVENIENCE SAMPLING. PLACING QUADRATS ONLY NEAR PATHS IN A FIELD MAY NOT REFLECT THE ENTIRE AREA'S BIODIVERSITY, LEADING TO BIASED RESULTS.

## ACTIVITY 1: PRACTICAL - USING QUADRATS TO COMPARE PLANT POPULATIONS

### SAFETY NOTE
WASH HANDS AFTER HANDLING TOOLS AND MATERIALS. BE CAUTIOUS NEAR PONDS OR AREAS WITH ANIMAL WASTE.

### HYPOTHESIS
INVESTIGATING TWO SCHOOL FIELD AREAS (AREA A AND AREA B), WHERE AREA A APPEARS LESS TRAMPLED AND HAS FEWER DANDELIONS, LEADS TO THE HYPOTHESIS: "THE DANDELION POPULATION IN AREA A IS SMALLER THAN THAT IN AREA B."

### SAMPLING METHOD
USE A GRID SYSTEM. IN AREA A, SET UP A 10-METER SQUARE WITH QUADRATS PLACED AT SPECIFIC COORDINATES (E.G., (2,6) AND (8,4)), ENSURING RANDOM PLACEMENT FOR UNBIASED SAMPLING.

THIS METHOD ALLOWS SYSTEMATIC PLACEMENT OF QUADRATS, AIDING ACCURATE COMPARISON OF DANDELION POPULATIONS BETWEEN AREAS.

# ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT: ECOSYSTEMS

## SAMPLING DANDELION POPULATIONS

TO STUDY DANDELION POPULATIONS IN A FIELD, RESEARCHERS USE QUADRAT SAMPLING. THE PROCESS INVOLVES:

1. **RANDOM SAMPLING**: A CALCULATOR GENERATES RANDOM COORDINATES TO POSITION QUADRATS WITHIN A SPECIFIC FIELD AREA.

2. **COUNTING**: RESEARCHERS COUNT DANDELIONS WITHIN EACH QUADRAT, REPEATING THIS FOR TEN QUADRATS IN THE FIRST AREA (AREA A).

3. **REPETITION IN ANOTHER AREA**: THE SAME PROCESS IS APPLIED TO A DIFFERENT SECTION OF THE FIELD (AREA B) USING ANOTHER SET OF QUADRATS.

### EXAMPLE DATA

THE TABLE BELOW ILLUSTRATES HYPOTHETICAL RESULTS FROM SUCH A STUDY:

| QUADRAT NUMBER | DANDELIONS IN AREA A | DANDELIONS IN AREA B |
|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| 1              | 10                     | 10                     |
| 2              | 14                     | 12                     |
| 3              | 8                      | 16                     |
| 4              | 3                      | 11                     |
| 5              | 12                     | 15                     |

### ANALYSIS

- **MEAN CALCULATION**: THE MEAN NUMBER OF DANDELIONS PER SQUARE METER IN EACH AREA IS FOUND BY SUMMING THE COUNTS AND DIVIDING BY TEN.

- **HYPOTHESIS TESTING**: RESULTS ARE EVALUATED TO DETERMINE IF POPULATION NUMBERS DIFFER BETWEEN AREAS.

- **RELIABILITY IMPROVEMENT**: CONSIDER INCREASING THE NUMBER OF QUADRATS SAMPLED OR ENSURING RANDOM PLACEMENT TO ENHANCE RESULT RELIABILITY.

## INTERACTIONS IN ECOSYSTEMS

ECOSYSTEMS EXHIBIT DYNAMIC INTERACTIONS AMONG ORGANISMS AND THEIR ENVIRONMENT. KEY INTERACTIONS INCLUDE:

1. **FEEDING**: ORGANISMS RECYCLE NUTRIENTS, CONTRIBUTING TO ECOSYSTEM SUSTAINABILITY.

2. **COMPETITION**: ANIMALS COMPETE FOR RESOURCES LIKE FOOD, SHELTER, MATES, AND NESTING SITES. PLANTS COMPETE FOR CARBON DIOXIDE, MINERAL IONS, LIGHT, AND WATER.

3. **ENVIRONMENTAL INTERACTIONS**:
   - PLANTS ABSORB MINERALS, CARBON DIOXIDE, AND WATER WHILE RELEASING WATER VAPOR AND OXYGEN.
   - ANIMALS USE ENVIRONMENTAL MATERIALS FOR SHELTERS.
   - TEMPERATURE INFLUENCES BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES, WITH ORGANISMS PRODUCING HEAT AFFECTING THEIR SURROUNDINGS.

### IMPORTANT REMINDER

PLANTS PERFORM PHOTOSYNTHESIS, CONVERTING CARBON DIOXIDE INTO OXYGEN UNDER SUFFICIENT LIGHT. IN LOW-LIGHT CONDITIONS, THEY MAY ABSORB OXYGEN AND RELEASE CARBON DIOXIDE INSTEAD. THIS PROCESS IS CRUCIAL FOR UNDERSTANDING ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS (REFER TO CHAPTER 10 FOR FURTHER DETAILS).

# ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT

## ECOSYSTEMS

### BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC FACTORS

IN AN ECOSYSTEM, VARIOUS FACTORS INFLUENCE THE NUMBERS AND DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS. THESE FACTORS CAN BE CATEGORIZED INTO TWO MAIN TYPES: **BIOTIC** AND **ABIOTIC**.

#### BIOTIC FACTORS
BIOTIC FACTORS ARE BIOLOGICAL INFLUENCES THAT OFTEN INVOLVE FEEDING RELATIONSHIPS. KEY BIOTIC FACTORS INCLUDE:

- **PREDATION**: THE RELATIONSHIP WHERE A PREDATOR KILLS AND EATS ANOTHER ANIMAL, AFFECTING POPULATION DYNAMICS.
- **PARASITISM**: A RELATIONSHIP WHERE A PARASITE LIVES IN OR ON ANOTHER ORGANISM (THE HOST) AND DERIVES NUTRITION FROM IT, SUCH AS MOSQUITOES PARASITIZING HUMANS.
- **DISEASE**: ILLNESSES THAT CAN AFFECT POPULATIONS AND REDUCE THEIR SIZE.
- **AVAILABILITY OF FOOD**: THE PRESENCE OF FOOD RESOURCES AND COMPETITION FOR THEM AMONG ORGANISMS.
- **PRESENCE OF POLLINATING INSECTS**: ESSENTIAL FOR PLANT REPRODUCTION, CONTRIBUTING TO ECOSYSTEM BALANCE.
- **AVAILABILITY OF NEST SITES**: IMPORTANT FOR BREEDING AND SHELTER, INFLUENCING SPECIES DISTRIBUTION.

#### ABIOTIC FACTORS
ABIOTIC FACTORS ARE PHYSICAL OR CHEMICAL INFLUENCES IN AN ECOSYSTEM. THEY INCLUDE:

- **CLIMATE**: FACTORS SUCH AS LIGHT INTENSITY, TEMPERATURE, AND WATER AVAILABILITY THAT INFLUENCE ECOSYSTEMS.
- **SOIL CONDITIONS**: CHARACTERISTICS LIKE CLAY CONTENT, NITRATE LEVELS, PARTICLE SIZE, WATER CONTENT, AND PH AFFECTING PLANT GROWTH.
- **HABITAT-SPECIFIC FACTORS**: SUCH AS SALINITY IN ESTUARIES, FLOW RATE IN RIVERS, OR OXYGEN CONCENTRATION IN LAKES, SHAPING AQUATIC LIFE.
- **POLLUTION**: THE PRESENCE OF HARMFUL SUBSTANCES IN THE ENVIRONMENT, DISRUPTING ECOSYSTEMS.

### FACTORS AFFECTING POPULATION SIZES
THE SPECIFIC FACTORS AFFECTING POPULATION SIZES AND DISTRIBUTION VARY BY ECOSYSTEM. FOR EXAMPLE, IN A RIVER ECOSYSTEM, BIOTIC FACTORS LIKE FOOD SUPPLY FROM PLANTS OR OTHER ANIMALS ARE CRUCIAL, WHILE ABIOTIC FACTORS SUCH AS WATER DEPTH AND FLOW RATE ALSO PLAY SIGNIFICANT ROLES. FOR INSTANCE, LARGE FISH MAY STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE IN SHALLOW STREAMS.

### INTERACTIONS BETWEEN FACTORS
THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THESE FACTORS CAN VARY WIDELY. IN HEAVILY POLLUTED AREAS, POLLUTION MAY DOMINATE, WHEREAS IN CLEANER ENVIRONMENTS, ABIOTIC CONDITIONS LIKE DEPTH AND FLOW RATE MIGHT BE MORE INFLUENTIAL. ADDITIONALLY, FACTORS OFTEN INTERACT. FOR EXAMPLE, A FASTER FLOW RATE CAN INCREASE DISSOLVED OXYGEN LEVELS, SUPPORTING AQUATIC LIFE.

### BIOMES
LARGE AREAS DOMINATED BY SPECIFIC VEGETATION TYPES ARE CALLED **BIOMES**. EXAMPLES INCLUDE TEMPERATE GRASSLANDS AND TROPICAL RAINFORESTS. CLIMATE, PARTICULARLY TEMPERATURE AND RAINFALL PATTERNS, IS THE PRIMARY FACTOR SHAPING BIOME DISTRIBUTION. TROPICAL RAINFORESTS THRIVE NEAR THE EQUATOR, WHILE PINE FORESTS ARE FOUND IN HIGHER LATITUDES OF THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE.

### RESEARCH OPPORTUNITY
RESEARCH COULD EXPLORE THE CHARACTERISTICS AND DYNAMICS OF DIFFERENT BIOMES, PROVIDING DEEPER INSIGHTS INTO ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES.

# ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT: ECOSYSTEMS

## FEEDING RELATIONSHIPS

THE SIMPLEST WAY OF ILLUSTRATING FEEDING RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN AN ECOSYSTEM IS THROUGH A **FOOD CHAIN**. IN ANY FOOD CHAIN, ARROWS INDICATE ENERGY FLOW DIRECTION, DENOTING "IS EATEN BY."

### EXAMPLE OF A SIMPLE FOOD CHAIN
- **GRASS** (PRODUCER): A PLANT THAT PHOTOSYNTHESIZES TO PRODUCE FOOD MATERIALS.
- **GRASSHOPPER** (PRIMARY CONSUMER): AN HERBIVORE THAT CONSUMES THE PRODUCER.
- **LIZARD** (SECONDARY CONSUMER): A CARNIVORE THAT EATS THE PRIMARY CONSUMER.

### TROPHIC LEVELS
THE STAGES IN A FOOD CHAIN ARE CALLED **TROPHIC LEVELS**, INCLUDING:
- **PRODUCERS**
- **PRIMARY CONSUMERS**
- **SECONDARY CONSUMERS**

### LONGER FOOD CHAINS

MANY FOOD CHAINS EXTEND BEYOND THREE LINKS. HERE ARE EXAMPLES:

1. **FRESHWATER FOOD CHAIN**:
   - FILAMENTOUS ALGAE → MAYFLY NYMPH → CADDIS FLY LARVAE → SALMON
   - THE SALMON IS A **TERTIARY CONSUMER**.

2. **MARINE FOOD CHAIN**:
   - PLANKTON → CRUSTACEAN → FISH → RINGED SEAL → POLAR BEAR
   - THE POLAR BEAR IS A **QUATERNARY CONSUMER**, KNOWN AS THE **TOP CARNIVORE** SINCE IT IS NOT PREYED UPON.

### LIMITATIONS OF FOOD CHAINS

FOOD CHAINS SIMPLIFY FEEDING RELATIONSHIPS, OFTEN INACCURATELY. FOR INSTANCE, THE MARINE CHAIN IMPLIES ONLY CRUSTACEANS FEED ON PLANKTON, IGNORING OTHER MAMMALS LIKE WHALES.

### FOOD WEBS

TO UNDERSTAND ECOSYSTEM COMPLEXITIES, WE EXAMINE **FOOD WEBS**, WHICH DEPICT MULTIPLE FEEDING INTERACTIONS.

#### EXAMPLE: SALMON FOOD WEB
IN A FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEM WITH SALMON AS TOP CARNIVORES:

- **YOUNG SALMON**: HAVE DISTINCT DIETS FROM MATURE SALMON.
- **MATURE SALMON**
- **CADDIS FLY LARVAE**
- **STONEFLY NYMPHS**
- **MAYFLY LARVAE**
- **BLACKFLY LARVAE**
- **FRESHWATER SHRIMP**
- **PLANKTON**
- **FILAMENTOUS ALGAE**
- **PLANT DETRITUS** (DEAD PLANT REMAINS)

THIS WEB ILLUSTRATES COMPLEX FEEDING RELATIONSHIPS IN THE ECOSYSTEM.

# ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT: ECOSYSTEMS

## UNDERSTANDING FOOD CHAINS AND FOOD WEBS

FOOD CHAINS AND FOOD WEBS ILLUSTRATE THE FEEDING RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN AN ECOSYSTEM. WHILE FOOD CHAINS PROVIDE A LINEAR REPRESENTATION OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS, FOOD WEBS OFFER A MORE COMPLEX VIEW, SHOWING HOW DIFFERENT FOOD CHAINS INTERCONNECT.

### PREDICTING CHANGES IN ECOSYSTEMS

CHANGES IN THE POPULATION OF ONE ORGANISM CAN HAVE CASCADING EFFECTS ON OTHERS WITHIN THE FOOD WEB. FOR INSTANCE:

- THE DECLINE OF LEECHES DUE TO DISEASE MAY LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN MIDGE LARVAE AS THEY FACE LESS COMPETITION.
- THE STONEFLY NYMPH POPULATION COULD DECREASE IF SALMON CONSUME MORE OF THEM WITH FEWER LEECHES PRESENT.
- POPULATION STABILITY MIGHT OCCUR DUE TO A BALANCE BETWEEN THESE FACTORS.

FOOD WEBS DO NOT PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE QUANTITY OR MASS OF ORGANISMS INVOLVED, NOR DO THEY HIGHLIGHT THE ROLE OF DECOMPOSERS IN THE ECOSYSTEM.

## ECOLOGICAL PYRAMIDS

ECOLOGICAL PYRAMIDS ARE VISUAL REPRESENTATIONS THAT DEPICT THE RELATIVE AMOUNTS OF ORGANISMS AT EACH TROPHIC LEVEL IN A FOOD CHAIN. THERE ARE TWO MAIN TYPES:

1. **PYRAMIDS OF NUMBERS**: THESE REPRESENT THE NUMBER OF ORGANISMS AT EACH TROPHIC LEVEL, REGARDLESS OF THEIR MASS.
2. **PYRAMIDS OF BIOMASS**: THESE SHOW THE TOTAL MASS OF ORGANISMS AT EACH TROPHIC LEVEL, IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR NUMBERS.

### EXAMPLE FOOD CHAINS

CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING TWO FOOD CHAINS:

- GRASS → GRASSHOPPER → FROG → BIRD
- OAK TREE → APHID → LADYBIRD → BIRD

FIGURES 14.8 AND 14.9 ILLUSTRATE THE PYRAMIDS OF NUMBERS AND BIOMASS FOR THESE TWO FOOD CHAINS.

#### PYRAMIDS OF NUMBERS (FIGURE 14.8)

- BIRDS
- FROGS
- GRASSHOPPERS
- GRASS

#### PYRAMIDS OF BIOMASS (FIGURE 14.9)

- BIRDS
- FROGS
- GRASSHOPPERS
- OAK TREE

### KEY POINTS

- **BIOMASS**: THIS TERM REFERS TO THE TOTAL MASS OF ORGANISMS. WHEN REFERRING TO LIVING ORGANISMS, IT IS CALLED FRESH BIOMASS. MORE COMMONLY, DRY BIOMASS IS USED, WHICH IS THE MASS AFTER WATER HAS BEEN REMOVED (E.G., BY DRYING IN AN OVEN). DRY BIOMASS IS A MORE RELIABLE MEASURE SINCE WATER CONTENT CAN VARY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS.

- **TRENDS IN BIOMASS**: IN THE GRASS FOOD CHAIN, BOTH PYRAMIDS OF NUMBERS AND BIOMASS DECREASE ALONG THE TROPHIC LEVELS. THE OAK TREE FOOD CHAIN SHOWS SIMILAR TRENDS BUT DUE TO THE SIZE OF THE OAK TREES, WHICH SUPPORT MANY APHIDS AND LADYBIRDS BEFORE NUMBERS DECREASE AT HIGHER TROPHIC LEVELS.

UNDERSTANDING THESE CONCEPTS IS CRUCIAL FOR GRASPING ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS AND THE ROLES OF ORGANISMS WITHIN THEM.

# ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT

## ECOSYSTEMS

### UNDERSTANDING FOOD CHAINS

A FOOD CHAIN DEMONSTRATES HOW ENERGY IS TRANSFERRED BETWEEN ORGANISMS IN AN ECOSYSTEM, ILLUSTRATING THE DIRECTION OF ENERGY FLOW THROUGH VARIOUS LEVELS.

### EXAMPLE OF A FOOD CHAIN

CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE:
- **OAK TREE** TRANSFERS ENERGY TO **APHID**, WHICH IS THEN CONSUMED BY **LADYBIRD**, FOLLOWED BY **BIRD**. THIS SEQUENCE SHOWS THE MOVEMENT OF ENERGY FROM PLANT TO PREDATOR.

### PYRAMID OF NUMBERS VS. PYRAMID OF BIOMASS

WHEN ANALYZING FOOD CHAINS, THE PYRAMID OF NUMBERS CAN BE MISLEADING DUE TO FACTORS LIKE PARASITISM. FOR INSTANCE:
- IN A PARASITIZED CHAIN: OAK TREE → APHID → LADYBIRD → BIRD → NEMATODE WORM
- THE PYRAMID OF NUMBERS MAY APPEAR DISTORTED DUE TO NUMEROUS PARASITES ON EACH BIRD.
- CONVERSELY, THE PYRAMID OF BIOMASS REMAINS BALANCED AS THE TOTAL MASS OF PARASITES IS LESS THAN THAT OF THEIR HOSTS.

### ENERGY LOSS IN FOOD CHAINS

ENERGY TRANSFER IN FOOD CHAINS IS INEFFICIENT. FOR EXAMPLE:
- WHEN A RABBIT CONSUMES GRASS, NOT ALL ENERGY IS CONVERTED INTO RABBIT TISSUE DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS:
  - PARTS LIKE ROOTS REMAIN UNEATEN.
  - UNDIGESTED MATERIALS ARE EXCRETED.
  - A SIGNIFICANT PORTION IS LOST THROUGH RESPIRATION AS CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER.

### KEY POINT

A FOOD CHAIN EFFECTIVELY ILLUSTRATES HOW ENERGY MOVES FROM ONE ORGANISM TO ANOTHER, REFLECTING THE DIRECTION OF ENERGY FLOW IN AN ECOSYSTEM.

# ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT

## ECOSYSTEMS

### THE FLOW OF ENERGY THROUGH ECOSYSTEMS

IN ECOSYSTEMS, ENERGY FLOWS BETWEEN VARIOUS TROPHIC LEVELS, INCLUDING PRODUCERS, CONSUMERS, AND DECOMPOSERS. FEEDING IS A PRIMARY METHOD OF TRANSFERRING ENERGY BETWEEN ORGANISMS. HOWEVER, ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE MATERIALS CONSUMED BY ORGANISMS, SUCH AS GRASS BY RABBITS, IS CONVERTED INTO NEW CELLS. THIS LOSS OF ENERGY AND BIOMASS OCCURS AT EACH STAGE OF THE FOOD CHAIN, RESULTING IN SMALLER AMOUNTS OF BIOMASS AVAILABLE FOR GROWTH AT SUCCESSIVE TROPHIC LEVELS.

THE PROCESS OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS FIXES SUNLIGHT ENERGY INTO CHEMICAL FORMS LIKE GLUCOSE AND STARCH. RESPIRATION THEN RELEASES THIS STORED ENERGY, ESSENTIAL FOR BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS SUCH AS MUSCLE CONTRACTION, GROWTH, REPRODUCTION, EXCRETION, AND ACTIVE TRANSPORT. IF THE ENERGY FROM RESPIRATION IS USED TO PRODUCE NEW CELLS, IT REMAINS FIXED IN THE ORGANISM'S MOLECULES AND CAN BE PASSED ON TO THE NEXT TROPHIC LEVEL THROUGH FEEDING. CONVERSELY, IF THE ENERGY IS USED FOR OTHER PROCESSES, IT ESCAPES AS HEAT, LEADING TO ENERGY LOSS AT EACH TROPHIC LEVEL.

ENERGY TRANSFER DIMINISHES SIGNIFICANTLY AS IT MOVES THROUGH TROPHIC LEVELS. PRODUCERS RECEIVE ENERGY FROM SUNLIGHT, PRIMARY CONSUMERS OBTAIN ABOUT 10% OF THIS ENERGY FROM PRODUCERS, SECONDARY CONSUMERS RECEIVE APPROXIMATELY 1% FROM PRIMARY CONSUMERS, TERTIARY CONSUMERS RECEIVE ABOUT 0.1% FROM SECONDARY CONSUMERS, AND QUATERNARY CONSUMERS RECEIVE ABOUT 0.001% FROM TERTIARY CONSUMERS. THIS EXPLAINS WHY FOOD CHAINS TYPICALLY DO NOT EXCEED FIVE TROPHIC LEVELS. IN SOME MARINE ECOSYSTEMS, HOWEVER, SIX TROPHIC LEVELS CAN EXIST DUE TO ABUNDANT LIGHT ENERGY.

### CYCLING NUTRIENTS THROUGH ECOSYSTEMS

THE CHEMICALS COMPOSING OUR BODIES ARE PART OF A CONTINUOUS CYCLE. FOR INSTANCE, CARBON ATOMS IN OUR BODIES MAY HAVE BEEN PART OF HISTORICAL FIGURES LIKE MAHATMA GANDHI OR WINSTON CHURCHILL. THIS RECYCLING OF SUBSTANCES IS INTEGRAL TO THE CYCLE OF LIFE, DEATH, AND DECAY.

MICROORGANISMS PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN THIS PROCESS. THEY BREAK DOWN COMPLEX ORGANIC MOLECULES FROM DEAD ANIMALS AND PLANTS INTO SIMPLER SUBSTANCES, WHICH ARE THEN RELEASED BACK INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS ENSURES ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR NEW LIFE, MAINTAINING BALANCE WITHIN ECOSYSTEMS.

# ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT: ECOSYSTEMS

## THE CARBON CYCLE

CARBON IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF BIOLOGICAL MOLECULES ESSENTIAL FOR LIFE. IT APPEARS IN CARBOHYDRATES, LIPIDS, PROTEINS, DNA, VITAMINS, AND OTHER ORGANIC COMPOUNDS. UNDERSTANDING THE CARBON CYCLE IS VITAL FOR COMPREHENDING HOW CARBON CIRCULATES THROUGH ECOSYSTEMS.

### KEY PROCESSES IN THE CARBON CYCLE

PHOTOSYNTHESIS PLAYS A CENTRAL ROLE IN THE CARBON CYCLE AS PLANTS FIX CARBON ATOMS FROM ATMOSPHERIC CARBON DIOXIDE INTO ORGANIC COMPOUNDS SUCH AS CARBOHYDRATES, LIPIDS, AND PROTEINS.

DECOMPOSITION, CARRIED OUT BY ORGANISMS LIKE FUNGI AND BACTERIA, BREAKS DOWN DEAD PLANT AND ANIMAL REMAINS, TRANSFERRING THEIR CARBON BACK INTO THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH PROCESSES LIKE DECAY AND EXCRETION.

RESPIRATION RELEASES INORGANIC CARBON DIOXIDE BACK INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AS PLANTS, ANIMALS, AND DECOMPOSERS BREAK DOWN ORGANIC COMPOUNDS TO GENERATE ENERGY.

FOSSILISATION TRAPS SOME ORGANIC MATTER IN SEDIMENTARY LAYERS UNDER SPECIFIC CONDITIONS, LEADING TO THE FORMATION OF FOSSIL FUELS SUCH AS COAL, OIL, NATURAL GAS, AND PEAT.

COMBUSTION OF THESE FOSSIL FUELS RELEASES CARBON DIOXIDE INTO THE ATMOSPHERE, CONTRIBUTING TO THE CARBON CYCLE.

### THE ROLE OF DECOMPOSERS

DECOMPOSERS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR RECYCLING ORGANIC MATTER. THEY BREAK DOWN DEAD PLANT AND ANIMAL MATERIAL, RETURNING NUTRIENTS TO THE SOIL AND RELEASING CARBON DIOXIDE THROUGH DECOMPOSITION.

THIS PROCESS ENSURES THAT CARBON CONTINUES TO CIRCULATE WITHIN ECOSYSTEMS, SUPPORTING BOTH LIVING ORGANISMS AND GEOLOGICAL FORMATIONS OVER TIME.

THE INTERPLAY OF THESE PROCESSES MAINTAINS THE DELICATE BALANCE OF CARBON IN ECOSYSTEMS, INFLUENCING CLIMATE AND BIODIVERSITY.

BY UNDERSTANDING THESE MECHANISMS, WE CAN BETTER APPRECIATE HOW HUMAN ACTIVITIES IMPACT THIS VITAL CYCLE.

# ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT: ECOSYSTEMS

## MEASURING BIODIVERSITY

ECOLOGY, AS A MATHEMATICAL BRANCH OF BIOLOGY, PROVIDES TOOLS TO ASSESS BIODIVERSITY. ONE WIDELY USED METHOD IS SIMPSON'S INDEX, WHICH QUANTIFIES SPECIES DIVERSITY IN A COMMUNITY.

### SIMPSON'S INDEX FORMULA

SIMPSON'S INDEX (D) MEASURES BIODIVERSITY BY COMPARING THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS IN EACH SPECIES TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE FORMULA IS:

\[ D = 1 - \FRAC{\SUM (N^2)}{N^2} \]

WHERE:
- **N** IS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS ACROSS ALL SPECIES.
- **N** IS THE COUNT OF INDIVIDUALS FOR A SPECIFIC SPECIES.

### STEPS TO CALCULATE SIMPSON'S INDEX

CALCULATING SIMPSON'S INDEX INVOLVES FIVE STEPS:

1. DETERMINE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS (N) IN THE COMMUNITY.
2. FOR EACH SPECIES, FIND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS (N).
3. SQUARE THE VALUE OF N FOR EACH SPECIES.
4. SUM ALL SQUARED VALUES TO GET \(\SUM (N^2)\).
5. APPLY THE FORMULA TO COMPUTE D.

### EXAMPLE CALCULATION

CONSIDER TWO COMMUNITIES:

| SPECIES | COMMUNITY 1 INDIVIDUALS | COMMUNITY 2 INDIVIDUALS |
|---------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| A       | 10                       | 46                      |
| B       | 10                       | 10                      |
| C       | 10                       | 10                      |
| D       | 10                       | 10                      |
| E       | 10                       | 10                      |

#### COMMUNITY 1:
- TOTAL INDIVIDUALS (N) = 50
- EACH SPECIES HAS N = 10

CALCULATIONS:
- SQUARED VALUES: \(10^2 = 100\) FOR EACH SPECIES.
- SUM OF SQUARES: \(5 \TIMES 100 = 500\)
- SIMPSON'S INDEX: 
  \[ D = 1 - \FRAC{500}{50^2} = 1 - \FRAC{500}{2500} = 0.80 \]
  
THIS RESULT (D = 0.80) INDICATES HIGH BIODIVERSITY IN COMMUNITY 1.

#### COMMUNITY 2:
- TOTAL INDIVIDUALS (N) = 50
- EACH SPECIES HAS N = 10

CALCULATIONS:
- SQUARED VALUES: \(10^2 = 100\) FOR EACH SPECIES.
- SUM OF SQUARES: \(5 \TIMES 100 = 500\)
- SIMPSON'S INDEX:
  \[ D = 1 - \FRAC{500}{50^2} = 0.80 \]
  
THIS RESULT (D = 0.152) SUGGESTS LOWER BIODIVERSITY COMPARED TO COMMUNITY 1.

### EXTENSION WORK

EXPLORING FURTHER, RESEARCH DIFFERENT BIODIVERSITY INDICES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS CAN ENHANCE UNDERSTANDING OF ECOLOGICAL METRICS.

THIS STRUCTURED LAYOUT PROVIDES A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF ECOSYSTEMS, THEIR COMPONENTS, AND RELATIONSHIPS WHILE ENCOURAGING CRITICAL THINKING.

# ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT: ECOSYSTEMS

## WOODLAND FOOD WEB

THE WOODLAND ECOSYSTEM CONSISTS OF INTERCONNECTED ORGANISMS WHERE EACH PLAYS A SPECIFIC ROLE. PREDATORS INCLUDE OWLS AND WEASELS, WHILE PRIMARY CONSUMERS ARE SHREWS, VOLES, AND SMALL BIRDS. DECOMPOSERS LIKE BEETLES AND EARTHWORMS BREAK DOWN ORGANIC MATTER, AND PRODUCERS ARE HERBS, TREES, AND BUSHES, INCLUDING OAK TREES AND DEAD LEAVES.

FOOD CHAINS ILLUSTRATE THE FLOW OF ENERGY WITHIN THE ECOSYSTEM. FOR EXAMPLE:

1. GRASS IS CONSUMED BY VOLES, WHICH ARE THEN PREYED UPON BY SHREWS, FOLLOWED BY OWLS.
2. DEAD LEAVES PROVIDE A FOOD SOURCE FOR EARTHWORMS, WHICH ARE EATEN BY SHREWS, LEADING TO WEASELS AS PREDATORS.

THE SHREW SERVES DUAL ROLES: IT ACTS AS A PRIMARY CONSUMER WHEN EATING PLANTS AND AS A SECONDARY CONSUMER WHEN PREYING ON INSECTS.

## PYRAMIDS OF NUMBERS AND BIOMASS

IN PART (B) OF THE DIAGRAM, TWO PYRAMIDS ARE ANALYZED:

- THE PYRAMID OF NUMBERS REPRESENTS ORGANISM DENSITY PER HECTARE.
- THE PYRAMID OF BIOMASS SHOWS ENERGY STORED IN ORGANISMS, MEASURED IN GRAMS PER SQUARE METER.

THE DIFFERENCE IN WIDTH BETWEEN LEVELS Y IN THESE PYRAMIDS IS DUE TO VARYING BIOMASS COMPARED TO ORGANISM NUMBERS. FOR INSTANCE, FEWER LARGE PREDATORS LIKE OWLS MAY HAVE MORE BIOMASS THAN NUMEROUS SMALL INSECTS.

## ENERGY TRANSFER IN ECOSYSTEMS

ENERGY TRANSFER WITHIN THE ECOSYSTEM IS ILLUSTRATED BY A COW FEEDING ON GRASS:

- GRASS PROVIDES 3050 KJ OF ENERGY.
- THE COW RETAINS 125 KJ AS NEW BIOMASS AND LOSES 2925 KJ THROUGH METABOLIC PROCESSES AND EXCRETION.
- UNUSED GRASS ENERGY, TOTALING 18450 KJ, CAN BE USED BY OTHER ORGANISMS OR CONTRIBUTE TO ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTIVITY.

THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF THE COW IS CALCULATED AS:

\[
\TEXT{ENERGY EFFICIENCY} = \LEFT( \FRAC{125}{3050} \RIGHT) \TIMES 100 \APPROX 4.1\%
\]

ENERGY LOSS OCCURS THROUGH METABOLISM AND EXCRETION, WHILE UNUSED GRASS ENERGY SUPPORTS DECOMPOSERS OR ECOSYSTEM GROWTH.

THIS STRUCTURED OVERVIEW CLARIFIES THE ROLES OF ORGANISMS IN A WOODLAND ECOSYSTEM, DETAILING FOOD CHAINS, DUAL ROLES, AND ENERGY DYNAMICS.
