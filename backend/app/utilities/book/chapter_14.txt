# 14 ECOSYSTEMS

An ecosystem is a distinct, self-supporting system of organisms interacting with each other and with a physical environment. An ecosystem can be small, such as a pond, or large, such as a mangrove swamp or a large forest. This chapter looks at a variety of ecosystems and the interactions that happen within them.

## THE COMPONENTS OF ECOSYSTEMS

Whatever their size, ecosystems usually have the same components:

- producers – plants which photosynthesise to produce food
- consumers – animals that eat plants or other animals
- decomposers – organisms that break down dead material and help to recycle nutrients
- the physical environment – all the non-biological components of the ecosystem; for example, the water and soil in a pond or the soil and air in a forest.

The living components of an ecosystem are called the biotic components. The non-living (physical) components are the abiotic components (compare these with biotic and abiotic factors, below).

An ecosystem contains a variety of habitats. A habitat is the place where an organism lives. For example, habitats in a pond ecosystem include the open water, the mud at the bottom of the pond, and the surface water.

All the organisms of a particular species found in an ecosystem at a certain time form the population of that species. All the immature frogs (tadpoles) swimming in a pond are a population of tadpoles; all the water lily plants growing in the pond make up a population of water lilies.

The populations of all species (animals, plants and other organisms) found in an ecosystem at a particular time form the community. Figure 14.3 illustrates the main components of a pond ecosystem.

[A diagram of a pond ecosystem is shown, illustrating various components such as:
- Sunlight
- Air
- Water
- Soil
- Floating plants in an open water habitat
- Plankton in an open water habitat
- Rooted plants: habitat is partly soil, partly water and may be partly air
- Snails' habitat is mainly the surface of soil and plants; small organisms are grazed
The diagram also indicates components of the physical environment and components of the biological community.]

### USING QUADRATS TO SAMPLE FROM A HABITAT

When an ecologist wants to know how many organisms there are in a particular habitat, it would not be possible for him to count them all. Instead, he is forced to count a smaller representative part of the population, called a sample. Sampling of plants, or animals that do not move much (such as snails), can be done using a sampling square called a quadrat. A quadrat is usually made from metal, wood or plastic. The size of quadrat you use depends on the size of the organisms being sampled. For example, to count plants growing on a school field, you could use a quadrat with sides 0.5 or 1 metre in length (Figure 14.4).

### KEY POINT

Decomposers are fungi and some species of bacteria. They feed by saprotrophic nutrition (see Chapter 2)

### HINT

People often mistakenly call quadrats 'quadrants'. A quadrant is quite different – it is a quarter of a circle.

A pair of random numbers is generated, using the random number function on a calculator. These numbers are used as coordinates to position the quadrat in the large square.

The numbers of dandelions in the quadrat are counted. The process is then repeated for nine more quadrats.

The tape measures are then moved to area B and the process repeated to sample from ten more quadrats in that part of the field.

The table below shows a set of results for a study like this.

Calculate the mean number of dandelions per m² in each area. Do the results support the hypothesis that the population numbers are different? How could you improve the reliability of the results?

## INTERACTIONS IN ECOSYSTEMS

The organisms in an ecosystem are continually interacting with each other and with their physical environment. Interactions include the following.

- Feeding among the organisms – the plants, animals and decomposers are continually recycling the same nutrients through the ecosystem.
- Competition among the organisms – animals compete for food, shelter, mates, nesting sites; plants compete for carbon dioxide, mineral ions, light and water.
- Interactions between organisms and the environment – plants absorb mineral ions, carbon dioxide and water from the environment; plants also give off water vapour and oxygen into the environment; animals use materials from the environment to build shelters; the temperature of the environment can affect processes occurring in the organisms; processes occurring in organisms can affect the temperature of the environment (all organisms produce some heat).

### REMINDER

Don't forget that plants take in carbon dioxide and give out oxygen only when there is sufficient light for photosynthesis to occur efficiently. When there is little light, plants take in oxygen and give out carbon dioxide. You should be able to explain the reasons for this (see Chapter 10).

## BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC FACTORS

There are many factors that influence the numbers and distribution of organisms in an ecosystem. There are two types of factor – biotic and abiotic.

Biotic factors are biological. Many (but not all) involve feeding relationships. They include:

- availability of food and competition for food resources
- predation
- parasitism
- disease
- presence of pollinating insects
- availability of nest sites.

Abiotic factors are physical or chemical factors. They include:

- climate, such as light intensity, temperature and water availability
- hours of daylight
- soil conditions, such as clay content, nitrate level, particle size, water content and pH
- other factors specific to a particular habitat, such as salinity (salt content) in an estuary, flow rate in a river, or oxygen concentration in a lake
- pollution.

Clearly which factors affect population sizes and distribution of organisms will depend on the type of ecosystem. If you take the example of a river, some of the main abiotic factors could be:

- depth of water
- flow rate
- type of material at the bottom of the stream (stones, sand, mud etc.)
- concentration of minerals in the water
- pH
- oxygen concentration
- cloudiness of the water
- presence of any pollution.

The main biotic factors affecting animals in the river will be food supply, either from plants or other animals. But other factors are important too – large fish could not live in a shallow stream!

It is impossible to generalise about which factors are the most important. In a heavily polluted river all the organisms could be killed by the pollution, while in a clean river depth and flow rate might have a greater effect on the animals that could live there. The different factors may also affect one another. For example, a faster flow rate could mix the water with air, increasing the amount of dissolved oxygen.

The main factor affecting large ecosystems is climate, particularly temperature and rainfall. Climate is the reason why tropical rainforests are restricted to a strip near the equator of the Earth, while pine forests grow in the higher latitudes of the northern hemisphere.

### KEY POINTS

A predator is an animal that kills and eats another animal. A parasite is an organism (animal or plant) that lives in or on another organism (called its host) and gets its nutrition from the host. e.g. mosquitoes are parasites of humans (and other animals), and the human is the host of the mosquito.

Large areas of the Earth dominated by a specific type of vegetation are called biomes. Temperate grassland and tropical rain forest are two examples of biomes. You could carry out some research to find out about these and other biomes.

## FEEDING RELATIONSHIPS

The simplest way of showing feeding relationships within an ecosystem is a food chain (Figure 14.6).

In any food chain, the arrow (→) means 'is eaten by'. In the food chain illustrated, the grass is the producer. It is a plant so it can photosynthesise and produce food materials. The grasshopper is the primary consumer. It is an animal which eats the producer and is also a herbivore. The lizard is the secondary consumer. It eats the primary consumer and is also a carnivore. The different stages in a food chain (producer, primary consumer and secondary consumer) are called trophic levels.

Many food chains have more than three links in them. Here are two examples of longer food chains:

filamentous algae → mayfly nymph → caddis fly larvae → salmon

In this freshwater food chain, the extra link in the chain makes the salmon a tertiary consumer.

plankton → crustacean → fish → ringed seal → polar bear

In this marine (sea) food chain, the fifth link makes the polar bear a quaternary consumer. Because nothing eats the polar bear, it is also called the top carnivore.

Food chains are a convenient way of showing the feeding relationships between a few organisms in an ecosystem, but they oversimplify the situation. The marine food chain above implies that only crustaceans feed on plankton, which is not true. Some whales and other mammals also feed on plankton. For a fuller understanding, you need to consider how the different food chains in an ecosystem relate to each other. Figure 14.7 gives a clearer picture of the feeding relationships involved in a freshwater ecosystem in which salmon are the top carnivores. This is the food web of the salmon.

## LOOKING AHEAD - MEASURING BIODIVERSITY

Ecology is a very mathematical branch of biology. An example of this is that biodiversity can be measured by calculating a diversity index. One example is called Simpson's Index. One formula for Simpson's Index (D) is:

$$ D = 1 - \sum(\frac{n}{N})^2 $$

In this formula:
- N = the total number of individuals of all species
- n = the total number of individuals of a particular species.

You calculate n/N for each species, square each of these numbers, and then sum (Σ) all the squares. Subtracting this value from 1 gives you D. Values of D range from 0 to 1, where 0 represents a low diversity and 1 a high diversity.

Take the data you saw in Table 14.1:

| Species | Number of individuals of each species in community 1 | Number of individuals of each species in community 2 |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| A       | 10                                                  | 1                                                   |
| B       | 10                                                  | 1                                                   |
| C       | 10                                                  | 1                                                   |
| D       | 10                                                  | 1                                                   |
| E       | 10                                                  | 46                                                  |

For community 1:
- The total number of individuals of all species (N) = 50
- For each species the total number of individuals (n) = 10.

So $\frac{n}{N} = \frac{10}{50} = 0.2$ for each species

$$ \sum(\frac{n}{N})^2 = (\frac{10}{50})^2 + (\frac{10}{50})^2 + (\frac{10}{50})^2 + (\frac{10}{50})^2 + (\frac{10}{50})^2 $$
$$ = 0.22 + 0.22 + 0.22 + 0.22 + 0.22 $$
$$ = 0.04 + 0.04 + 0.04 + 0.04 + 0.04 $$
$$ = 0.20 $$

To find Simpson's Index you subtract this value from 1:
$$ D = (1 - 0.20) = 0.80 $$

This value is close to 1.0, showing that community 1 has a high biodiversity.

Can you calculate Simpson's Index for community 2? If you do it carefully you should get the answer D = 0.152, showing that community 2 has a lower biodiversity.

If you are interested, you can do some background research about Simpson's Index. You will find that there are different formulae used for the Index. It doesn't matter which one you use, as long as you are consistent.
