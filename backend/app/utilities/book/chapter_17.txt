# VARIATION AND SELECTION: CELL DIVISION

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES
BY THE END OF THIS CHAPTER, YOU SHOULD:
- UNDERSTAND HOW DIPLOID CELL DIVISION BY MITOSIS PRODUCES TWO IDENTICAL CELLS WITH IDENTICAL CHROMOSOME SETS.
- RECOGNIZE THE ROLE OF RANDOM FERTILIZATION IN GENERATING GENETIC VARIATION IN OFFSPRING.
- DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN GENETIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND COMBINED SOURCES OF VARIATION WITHIN A SPECIES.
- EXPLAIN HOW MEIOSIS DIVIDES A PARENT CELL INTO FOUR HAPLOID GAMETES, EACH WITH HALF THE NUMBER OF CHROMOSOMES.

## INTRODUCTION TO CELL DIVISION
CELL DIVISION IS ESSENTIAL FOR GROWTH AND REPRODUCTION IN LIVING ORGANISMS. IT INVOLVES TWO PRIMARY TYPES: MITOSIS AND MEIOSIS.

### KEY TYPES OF CELL DIVISION

#### MITOSIS
MITOSIS PRODUCES TWO IDENTICAL DAUGHTER CELLS FROM A PARENT CELL. EACH DAUGHTER CELL INHERITS THE SAME SET OF CHROMOSOMES AS THE PARENT, ENSURING GROWTH AND REPAIR WITHOUT GENETIC VARIATION.

#### MEIOSIS
MEIOSIS GENERATES FOUR HAPLOID GAMETES FROM A PARENT CELL, EACH CONTAINING HALF THE NUMBER OF CHROMOSOMES. THIS PROCESS IS CRUCIAL FOR SEXUAL REPRODUCTION, ENABLING GENETIC DIVERSITY THROUGH RANDOM FERTILIZATION.

### CHROMOSOME STRUCTURE
HUMAN DIPLOID CELLS HAVE 46 CHROMOSOMES (23 HOMOLOGOUS PAIRS). HAPLOID GAMETES CONTAIN 23 CHROMOSOMES, ONE FROM EACH PAIR.

UNDERSTANDING MITOSIS AND MEIOSIS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO GRASPING CELLULAR GROWTH, REPRODUCTION, AND GENETIC VARIATION.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION: CELL DIVISION

CELL DIVISION IS ESSENTIAL FOR ENSURING THAT EACH DAUGHTER CELL INHERITS ONE COPY OF EVERY CHROMOSOME. IF THIS PROCESS FAILS, THE DAUGHTER CELLS MAY LACK NECESSARY GENES.

## STAGES OF MITOSIS

MITOSIS CONSISTS OF SEVERAL DISTINCT PHASES, AS ILLUSTRATED IN **FIGURE 17.1**. BELOW IS AN OVERVIEW OF EACH PHASE:

### PROPHASE
BEFORE MITOSIS BEGINS, DNA REPLICATES, FORMING TWO IDENTICAL COPIES CALLED CHROMATIDS. DURING PROPHASE, THESE CHROMATIDS BECOME VISIBLE AND CONNECT AT THE CENTROMERE. THE NUCLEAR MEMBRANE ALSO BEGINS TO DISASSEMBLE.

### METAPHASE
DURING METAPHASE, A STRUCTURE KNOWN AS THE SPINDLE FORMS. CHROMOSOMES ALIGN ALONG THE EQUATOR OF THIS SPINDLE, EACH ATTACHED BY THEIR CENTROMERES.

### ANAPHASE
IN ANAPHASE, SPINDLE FIBERS CONTRACT, PULLING CHROMATIDS TOWARD OPPOSITE ENDS (POLES) OF THE CELL. THIS SEPARATES THE CHROMATIDS INTO INDIVIDUAL CHROMOSOMES FOR THE TWO DAUGHTER CELLS.

### TELOPHASE
TELOPHASE CONCLUDES MITOSIS, FORMING TWO NEW NUCLEI AT THE POLES OF THE CELL. THE CYTOPLASM DIVIDES, RESULTING IN TWO DAUGHTER CELLS, EACH CONTAINING A COMPLETE SET OF CHROMOSOMES FROM THE PARENT CELL.

!FIGURE 17.1 ILLUSTRATES THE STAGES OF MITOSIS. FOR SIMPLICITY, THE DEPICTED CELL CONTAINS TWO HOMOLOGOUS CHROMOSOME PAIRS (ONE LONG AND ONE SHORT). THE NAMES OF THESE STAGES ARE NOT REQUIRED FOR UNDERSTANDING THIS PROCESS.

## OBSERVING MITOSIS

**FIGURE 17.2** SHOWS A MICROGRAPH OF ROOT TIP CELLS FROM AN ONION. THESE CELLS UNDERGO MITOSIS, ENABLING ROOT GROWTH THROUGH DIVISION.

CAN YOU IDENTIFY ANY STAGES OF MITOSIS IN **FIGURE 17.1**? UNDERSTANDING THESE PHASES IS CRUCIAL FOR GRASPING HOW ORGANISMS GROW AND DEVELOP VIA CELL DIVISION.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION

## CELL DIVISION

CELL DIVISION IS A FUNDAMENTAL BIOLOGICAL PROCESS ESSENTIAL FOR GROWTH, REPAIR, AND REPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS. IT OCCURS IN TWO PRIMARY FORMS: **MITOSIS** AND **MEIOSIS**.

### MITOSIS

MITOSIS INVOLVES THE DIVISION OF A SINGLE PARENT CELL INTO TWO GENETICALLY IDENTICAL DAUGHTER CELLS. EACH DAUGHTER CELL RECEIVES A COMPLETE SET OF CHROMOSOMES FROM THE PARENT CELL, ENSURING GENETIC IDENTITY BETWEEN THEM AND THE PARENT.

- IN MITOSIS, EACH DAUGHTER CELL INHERITS AN EXACT COPY OF EVERY CHROMOSOME AND GENE FROM THE PARENT CELL.
- SOMATIC CELLS (NON-REPRODUCTIVE CELLS) IN THE BODY ARE GENETICALLY IDENTICAL TO THE ZYGOTE FORMED AT FERTILIZATION.
- MITOSIS IS PREVALENT IN TISSUES THAT REQUIRE CONSTANT REPLACEMENT, SUCH AS THE SKIN, GUT LINING, AND RED BLOOD CELLS.

**EXAMPLES OF MITOTIC DIVISION:**
- **SKIN CELLS:** CONTINUOUSLY REPLACED DUE TO WEAR AND TEAR.
- **GUT LINING CELLS:** RAPID TURNOVER AS FOOD PASSES THROUGH.
- **RED BLOOD CELLS:** RAPIDLY REGENERATED IN THE BONE MARROW.

CANCER CELLS ALSO DIVIDE VIA MITOSIS, PRODUCING IDENTICAL DAUGHTER CELLS THAT MAY CARRY MUTATIONS LEADING TO UNCONTROLLED GROWTH.

### MEIOSIS

MEIOSIS IS A SPECIALIZED FORM OF CELL DIVISION PRODUCING GAMETES (SPERM AND EGG CELLS). IT OCCURS IN TWO STAGES: **MEIOSIS I** AND **MEIOSIS II**, RESULTING IN FOUR HAPLOID CELLS. EACH DAUGHTER CELL IS GENETICALLY DISTINCT FROM THE PARENT AND EACH OTHER.

- IN MEIOSIS, THE PARENT CELL FIRST COPIES EACH CHROMOSOME TO ENSURE SUFFICIENT GENETIC MATERIAL FOR FOUR DAUGHTERS.
- DURING MEIOSIS I, HOMOLOGOUS CHROMOSOMES SEPARATE, ENSURING EACH DAUGHTER CELL RECEIVES ONE CHROMOSOME FROM EACH PAIR.

THIS PROCESS GENERATES GENETIC DIVERSITY, CRUCIAL FOR SEXUAL REPRODUCTION.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION IN CELL DIVISION

## MEIOSIS: AN OVERVIEW

MEIOSIS IS A SPECIALIZED TYPE OF CELL DIVISION THAT REDUCES THE CHROMOSOME NUMBER BY HALF, RESULTING IN FOUR HAPLOID GAMETES. THIS PROCESS IS ESSENTIAL FOR SEXUAL REPRODUCTION AND CONTRIBUTES TO GENETIC DIVERSITY.

### STAGES OF MEIOSIS

THE STAGES OF MEIOSIS INVOLVE TWO MAIN DIVISIONS: MEIOSIS I AND MEIOSIS II.

1. **FIRST DIVISION (MEIOSIS I)**:
   - THE NUCLEUS OF THE PARENT CELL DIVIDES.
   - CHROMOSOMES PAIR UP IN HOMOLOGOUS PAIRS.
   - ONE CHROMOSOME FROM EACH HOMOLOGOUS PAIR IS DISTRIBUTED INTO EACH DAUGHTER CELL.
   - RESULT: TWO NUCLEI, EACH WITH HALF THE ORIGINAL CHROMOSOME NUMBER.

2. **SECOND DIVISION (MEIOSIS II)**:
   - THE TWO CHROMATIDS OF EACH CHROMOSOME SEPARATE.
   - EACH DAUGHTER CELL RECEIVES ONE PART OF THE CHROMOSOME.
   - RESULT: FOUR HAPLOID GAMETES ARE FORMED.

### GENETIC VARIATION

THE GAMETES PRODUCED THROUGH MEIOSIS DO NOT ALL HAVE THE SAME COMBINATIONS OF ALLELES, LEADING TO GENETIC VARIATION. THIS VARIATION ARISES BECAUSE:

- DURING THE TWO DIVISIONS OF MEIOSIS, THE CHROMOSOMES OF EACH HOMOLOGOUS PAIR ARE DISTRIBUTED INDEPENDENTLY OF EACH OTHER.
- THIS INDEPENDENT ASSORTMENT ALLOWS FOR A WIDE RANGE OF POSSIBLE GENETIC COMBINATIONS IN THE DAUGHTER CELLS.

### KEY POINTS

- MEIOSIS CONSISTS OF TWO MAIN DIVISIONS: MEIOSIS I AND MEIOSIS II.
- EACH DIVISION CONTRIBUTES TO THE REDUCTION OF CHROMOSOME NUMBER AND THE GENERATION OF GENETIC DIVERSITY.
- THE PROCESS OF MEIOSIS IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE FORMATION OF GAMETES IN SEXUAL REPRODUCTION.

UNDERSTANDING MEIOSIS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO GRASPING HOW GENETIC VARIATION OCCURS IN POPULATIONS, WHICH IS A KEY CONCEPT IN THE STUDY OF EVOLUTION AND NATURAL SELECTION.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION

## CELL DIVISION

CELL DIVISION IS A FUNDAMENTAL PROCESS IN THE LIFE CYCLE OF ORGANISMS, PARTICULARLY IN THE FORMATION OF GAMETES THROUGH MEIOSIS. IN HUMANS, EACH CELL CONTAINS THREE PAIRS OF HOMOLOGOUS CHROMOSOMES: A1, A2; B1, B2; AND C1, C2. EACH PAIR CONSISTS OF DIFFERENT ALLELES FOR CERTAIN GENES.

### MEIOSIS

MEIOSIS INVOLVES TWO DIVISIONS THAT RESULT IN THE CREATION OF SEX CELLS (GAMETES). EACH GAMETE RECEIVES ONE CHROMOSOME FROM EACH HOMOLOGOUS PAIR, LEADING TO GENETIC VARIATION AMONG THE PRODUCED GAMETES.

#### MATHEMATICAL RULE FOR COMBINATIONS

THERE IS A MATHEMATICAL FORMULA TO PREDICT THE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE CHROMOSOME COMBINATIONS DURING MEIOSIS:

**NUMBER OF POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS = 2^N**

WHERE **N** REPRESENTS THE NUMBER OF CHROMOSOME PAIRS.

- FOR TWO PAIRS: NUMBER OF COMBINATIONS = 2^2 = 4
- FOR THREE PAIRS: NUMBER OF COMBINATIONS = 2^3 = 8
- IN HUMANS, WITH 23 PAIRS: NUMBER OF COMBINATIONS = 2^23 = 8,388,608

### COMPARISON OF MITOSIS AND MEIOSIS

MITOSIS AND MEIOSIS DIFFER IN SEVERAL KEY ASPECTS:

- **CHROMOSOMES BEFORE DIVISION**: BOTH PROCESSES INVOLVE COPYING CHROMOSOMES BEFORE DIVISION.
- **NUMBER OF DIVISIONS**: MITOSIS INVOLVES ONE DIVISION, WHILE MEIOSIS INCLUDES TWO.
- **DAUGHTER CELLS PRODUCED**: MITOSIS RESULTS IN TWO DAUGHTER CELLS, WHEREAS MEIOSIS PRODUCES FOUR.
- **HAPLOID OR DIPLOID STATE**: DAUGHTER CELLS OF MITOSIS REMAIN DIPLOID, WHEREAS THOSE OF MEIOSIS ARE HAPLOID.
- **GENETIC VARIATION**: MEIOSIS INTRODUCES GENETIC VARIATION THROUGH CROSSING OVER AND INDEPENDENT ASSORTMENT.

## SEXUAL REPRODUCTION AND VARIATION

SEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS INVOLVES THE FUSION OF TWO GAMETES TO FORM A ZYGOTE. THIS PROCESS LEADS TO GENETIC VARIATION DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS:

1. **VARIATION IN GAMETES**: EACH GAMETE IS GENETICALLY UNIQUE BECAUSE OF DISTINCT ALLELE COMBINATIONS.
2. **RANDOM FERTILIZATION**: ANY SPERM CAN FERTILIZE ANY OVUM, RESULTING IN NUMEROUS POSSIBLE CHROMOSOME COMBINATIONS.

IN HUMANS, APPROXIMATELY 8.5 MILLION DIFFERENT TYPES OF GAMETES EXIST. UPON FERTILIZATION, THE ZYGOTE CAN HAVE UP TO 72 TRILLION (7.2 X 10^13) POSSIBLE CHROMOSOME COMBINATIONS, SUGGESTING THAT MOST INDIVIDUALS ARE GENETICALLY UNIQUE, EXCEPT FOR IDENTICAL TWINS.

### IDENTICAL TWINS

IDENTICAL TWINS, OR MONOZYGOTIC TWINS, ORIGINATE FROM A SINGLE ZYGOTE. THROUGH MITOSIS, THE ZYGOTE DIVIDES INTO TWO GENETICALLY IDENTICAL CELLS, EACH DEVELOPING INTO AN EMBRYO. THIS PROCESS HIGHLIGHTS THE ROLE OF MEIOSIS AND SEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN GENERATING GENETIC DIVERSITY WITHIN POPULATIONS.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION

## CLONING PROCESS
CLONING IS A METHOD USED TO PRODUCE GENETICALLY IDENTICAL OFFSPRING FROM A PART OF A PARENT ORGANISM. UNLIKE SEXUAL REPRODUCTION, WHICH INVOLVES GAMETES, CLONING DOES NOT USE GAMETES.

---

## DWARF PEA PLANTS
SHORT PEA PLANTS ARE REFERRED TO AS 'DWARF' VARIETIES. THE GENETICS BEHIND THEIR HEIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE EXPLORED IN CHAPTER 18.

---

## ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION AND CLONING
PLANT BREEDERS RECOGNIZE THAT SEXUAL REPRODUCTION INTRODUCES VARIATION, WHICH CAN BE UNDESIRABLE WHEN A SPECIFIC TRAIT IS DESIRED. CLONING ALLOWS THE PRODUCTION OF MANY IDENTICAL PLANTS FROM JUST A FEW CELLS OF THE ORIGINAL PLANT (AS DETAILED IN CHAPTER 19).

ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION OCCURS WITHOUT THE FUSION OF GAMETES. A PART OF THE ORGANISM GROWS AND SEPARATES, WITH CELLS FORMED BY MITOSIS THAT ARE GENETICALLY IDENTICAL TO THE PARENT. THIS PROCESS RESULTS IN OFFSPRING THAT ARE BOTH GENETICALLY IDENTICAL TO EACH OTHER AND TO THE PARENT.

---

## GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL VARIATION
PEA PLANTS EXHIBIT VARIATION IN HEIGHT, WHICH IS INFLUENCED BY BOTH GENETIC FACTORS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. WHILE ALL TALL PEA PLANTS MAY NOT BE EXACTLY THE SAME HEIGHT, AND SIMILARLY FOR SHORT PLANTS, THIS VARIATION ARISES FROM A COMBINATION OF GENETIC INHERITANCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCE.

A BAR CHART (FIGURE 17.7) ILLUSTRATES THE RANGE OF HEIGHTS OBSERVED AMONG PEA PLANTS, REFLECTING THESE DUAL INFLUENCES.

---

## SUMMARY
BOTH GENETIC FACTORS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS CONTRIBUTE TO THE VARIATION SEEN IN ORGANISMS. CLONING AND ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION ARE METHODS USED TO PRODUCE GENETICALLY IDENTICAL OFFSPRING, WHILE SEXUAL REPRODUCTION INTRODUCES DIVERSITY. UNDERSTANDING THESE CONCEPTS IS ESSENTIAL FOR FIELDS SUCH AS AGRICULTURE AND GENETICS.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION

## CHAPTER QUESTIONS
- **SKILLS**
- **CRITICAL THINKING**

---

### CELL DIVISION

SEVERAL ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS CAN INFLUENCE PLANT GROWTH. FOR INSTANCE:

- LIGHT: NOT ALL PLANTS RECEIVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF LIGHT, AFFECTING THEIR ABILITY TO PHOTOSYNTHESIZE.
- WATER AND MINERALS: VARIATIONS IN WATER AND MINERAL ION AVAILABILITY FROM THE SOIL CAN IMPACT THE PRODUCTION OF ESSENTIAL SUBSTANCES IN PLANTS.
- CARBON DIOXIDE: DIFFERENCES IN CARBON DIOXIDE LEVELS CAN ALSO AFFECT PHOTOSYNTHESIS.

SIMILAR PRINCIPLES APPLY TO HUMANS. IDENTICAL TWINS SHARE THE SAME GENES BUT MAY NOT BE IDENTICAL DUE TO ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES, AFFECTING THEIR PHYSICAL, SOCIAL, AND INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT DIFFERENTLY.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION

## CELL DIVISION

CELLS CAN DIVIDE THROUGH TWO PRIMARY PROCESSES: **MITOSIS** AND **MEIOSIS**. UNDERSTANDING THE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN THESE PROCESSES IS ESSENTIAL FOR GRASPING HOW ORGANISMS GROW AND REPRODUCE.

### SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES

- **SIMILARITY:** BOTH MITOSIS AND MEIOSIS INVOLVE DIVIDING A CELL TO PRODUCE NEW CELLS.
- **DIFFERENCE 1:** MITOSIS RESULTS IN TWO IDENTICAL DAUGHTER CELLS, WHEREAS MEIOSIS PRODUCES FOUR GENETICALLY DIVERSE DAUGHTER CELLS.
- **DIFFERENCE 2:** MITOSIS IS UTILIZED FOR GROWTH AND REPAIR, WHILE MEIOSIS IS EMPLOYED FOR GENERATING GAMETES (SPERM AND EGGS).

**CANCER CELLS:**
CANCER CELLS TYPICALLY UNDERGO MITOSIS. THIS UNCONTROLLED DIVISION LEADS TO TUMOR FORMATION.

**MEIOSIS AS REDUCTION DIVISION:**
MEIOSIS IS REFERRED TO AS A REDUCTION DIVISION BECAUSE IT REDUCES THE CHROMOSOME NUMBER BY HALF, CONVERTING DIPLOID CELLS INTO HAPLOID CELLS.

## REPRODUCTION IN DAFFODILS

DAFFODILS CAN ENGAGE IN BOTH SEXUAL AND ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION.

- **SEXUAL REPRODUCTION:** RESULTS IN SEEDS, LEADING TO GENETIC VARIATION AMONG OFFSPRING.
- **ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION:** INVOLVES THE FORMATION OF BULBS, PRODUCING PLANTS GENETICALLY IDENTICAL TO THE PARENT.

### EXPLANATION
- BULBS FROM A SINGLE DAFFODIL PLANT YIELD CLONES SIMILAR TO EACH OTHER AND THE PARENT.
- SEEDS FROM A SINGLE DAFFODIL PLANT PRODUCE VARIED PLANTS DUE TO GENETIC RECOMBINATION DURING SEXUAL REPRODUCTION.

## EXPERIMENT WITH CLOVER PLANTS

THE DIAGRAM ILLUSTRATES TWO CUTTINGS FROM THE SAME CLOVER PLANT, PLANTED IN IDENTICAL SOIL. AFTER SEVERAL DAYS, NITROGEN-FIXING BACTERIA WERE ADDED TO ONE POT (INOCULATED), WHILE THE OTHER REMAINED UNTREATED (NOT INOCULATED).

### QUESTIONS
1. **CONTROL GROUP:** THE UNTREATED POT IS KNOWN AS THE CONTROL GROUP.
2. **CUTTINGS VS. SEEDS:** CUTTINGS ENSURE IDENTICAL GENETIC MATERIAL, CLARIFYING ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS ON GROWTH.
3. **GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCE:** THE EXPERIMENT SUGGESTS GENETICS SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE CLOVER HEIGHT, WITH ENVIRONMENT ALSO PLAYING A ROLE THROUGH FACTORS LIKE NITROGEN-FIXING BACTERIA.

## MITOSIS VS. MEIOSIS IN DIFFERENT CELLS

- **SPERM PRODUCTION (TESTES):** MEIOSIS, AS IT GENERATES GAMETES.
- **INTESTINAL LINING CELLS:** MITOSIS, FOR GROWTH AND REPAIR.
- **BONE MARROW CELLS (WHITE BLOOD CELLS):** MITOSIS, TO REPLENISH BLOOD CELLS.
- **POLLEN GRAIN FORMATION (ANTHER OF FLOWER):** MEIOSIS, PRODUCING MALE GAMETES.
- **ZYGOTE TO EMBRYO:** MITOSIS, INITIAL GROWTH PHASE.

## VARIATION IN ORGANISMS

VARIATION CAN RESULT FROM GENETIC OR ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. EACH EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATES THESE INFLUENCES:

- **EYE COLOR IN HUMANS:** GENETIC, DETERMINED BY INHERITED GENES.
- **HUMAN SEX RATIO:** GENETIC, DICTATED BY CHROMOSOMES.
- **HYDRANGEA FLOWER COLORS:** ENVIRONMENTAL, AS SOIL PH AFFECTS COLOR WITHOUT ALTERING GENETICS.

### SKILLS DEVELOPMENT

- **CRITICAL THINKING:** ANALYZING MITOSIS AND MEIOSIS FOR GENETIC DIVERSITY IMPLICATIONS.
- **REASONING:** UNDERSTANDING ROLES OF GENETICS AND ENVIRONMENT IN ORGANISMAL VARIATION.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION

## UNDERSTANDING VARIATION

IN NATURE, VARIATION IS A COMMON PHENOMENON. FOR EXAMPLE, IN PEA PLANTS, SOME EXHIBIT TALL HEIGHT WHILE OTHERS DISPLAY DWARF CHARACTERISTICS. NOTABLY, EVEN AMONG THE TALL PLANTS, THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN HEIGHT, AND SIMILARLY, WITHIN THE DWARF PLANTS, VARIATIONS EXIST. THIS INHERENT VARIATION IS CRUCIAL FOR THE PROCESS OF NATURAL SELECTION.

## HUMAN VARIATION

IN HUMAN POPULATIONS, FAMILIES MAY HAVE VARYING RISKS OF CONDITIONS LIKE HEART DISEASE. HOWEVER, NOT EVERY MEMBER OF A HIGH-RISK FAMILY WILL EXPERIENCE A HEART ATTACK, AND SOME INDIVIDUALS FROM LOW-RISK FAMILIES MAY STILL DEVELOP HEART ISSUES. THIS ILLUSTRATES THAT VARIATION EXISTS WITHIN POPULATIONS, INFLUENCING HEALTH OUTCOMES.

## CELL DIVISION: MITOSIS

### INVESTIGATING MITOSIS

IN STUDIES OF MITOSIS, RESEARCHERS MEASURE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN CHROMOSOMES AND THE POLES OF A CELL. THIS MEASUREMENT IS VITAL FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW CELLS DIVIDE AND REPLICATE.

#### KEY TERMS:
- **CENTROMERE**: THE REGION WHERE TWO SISTER CHROMATIDS ARE JOINED.
- **SPINDLE FIBRES**: STRUCTURES THAT FACILITATE CHROMOSOME SEPARATION DURING CELL DIVISION.
- **POLE OF CELL**: THE ENDS OF THE CELL WHERE SPINDLE FIBRES ATTACH.

### GRAPH ANALYSIS

THE GRAPH ILLUSTRATES HOW DISTANCES BETWEEN CHROMOSOMES AND CELL POLES CHANGE DURING MITOSIS. IT PROVIDES A VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF THIS DYNAMIC PROCESS.

#### QUESTIONS FOR ANALYSIS:
1. IN STAGE A, DESCRIBE TWO EVENTS THAT OCCUR.
2. IN STAGE B, EXPLAIN WHAT IS HAPPENING.
3. IN STAGE C, DESCRIBE TWO EVENTS THAT OCCUR.

UNDERSTANDING THESE STAGES AIDS IN GRASPING HOW CELLS REPLICATE AND THE ROLE OF GENETIC VARIATION DURING MITOSIS.
