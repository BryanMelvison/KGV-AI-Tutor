# CELL DIVISION

Growth and reproduction are two characteristics of living things. Both involve cell division, which is the subject of this chapter.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

- Understand how division of a diploid cell by mitosis produces two cells that contain identical sets of chromosomes
- Understand that mitosis occurs during growth, repair, cloning and asexual reproduction
- Understand how division of a cell by meiosis produces four cells, each with half the number of chromosomes, and that this results in the formation of genetically different haploid gametes
- Understand how random fertilisation produces genetic variation of offspring
- Understand that variation within a species can be genetic, environmental or a combination of both

In most parts of the body, cells need to divide so that organisms can grow and replace worn out or damaged cells. The cells that are produced in this type of cell division should be exactly the same as the cells they are replacing. This is the most common form of cell division.

Only in the sex organs is cell division different. Here, some cells divide to produce gametes (sex cells), which contain only half the original number of chromosomes. This is so that when male and female gametes fuse together (fertilisation) the resulting cell (called a zygote) will contain the full set of chromosomes and can then divide and grow into a new individual.

Human body cells are diploid – they have 46 chromosomes in 23 homologous pairs. The gametes, with 23 chromosomes (one copy of each homologous chromosome), are haploid cells.

There are two kind of cell division: mitosis and meiosis. When cells divide by mitosis, two cells are formed. These have the same number and type of chromosomes as the original cell. Mitosis forms all the cells in our bodies except the gametes.

> **KEY POINT**
> 
> Meiosis is sometimes called a reduction division. This is because it produces cells with only half the number of chromosomes of the original cell.

When cells divide by meiosis, four cells are formed. These have only half the number of chromosomes of the original cell. Meiosis forms gametes.

## MITOSIS

When a 'parent' cell divides it produces 'daughter' cells. Mitosis produces two daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell – both daughter cells have the same number and type of chromosomes as the parent cell.

To achieve this, the dividing cell must do two things.

- It must copy each chromosome before it divides. This involves the DNA replicating and more proteins being added to the structure. Each daughter cell will then be able to receive a copy of each chromosome (and each molecule of DNA) when the cell divides.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION

## CELL DIVISION

It must divide in such a way that each daughter cell receives one copy of every chromosome. If it does not do this, both daughter cells will not contain all the genes.

(a) prophase

centromere | Before mitosis the DNA replicates and the chromosomes form two exact copies called chromatids. During the first stage of mitosis (prophase) the chromatids become visible, joined at a centromere. The nuclear membrane breaks down.
--- | ---
two chromatids | 

(b) metaphase

spindle | During metaphase a structure called the spindle forms. The chromosomes line up at the 'equator' of the spindle, attached to it by their centromeres.
--- | ---

(c) anaphase

During anaphase, the spindle fibres shorten and pull the chromatids to the opposite ends ('poles') of the cell. The chromatids separate to become the chromosomes of the two daughter cells.

(c) telophase

In the last stage (telophase) two new nuclei form at the poles of the cell. The cytoplasm starts to divide to produce two daughter cells. Both daughter cells have a copy of each chromosome from the parent cell.

▲ Figure 17.1 The stages of mitosis. For simplicity the cell shown contains two homologous pairs of chromosomes (one long pair, one short). (You do not need to remember the names of the stages.)

A number of distinct stages occur when a cell divides by mitosis. These are shown in Figure 17.1. Figure 17.2 is a photograph of some cells from the root tip of an onion. Cells in this region of the root divide by mitosis to allow growth of the root.

▲ Figure 17.2 Cells in the root tip of an onion dividing by mitosis. Can you identify any of the stages shown in Figure 17.1?

## CELL DIVISION

Each daughter cell formed by mitosis receives a copy of every chromosome, and therefore every gene, from the parent cell. Each daughter cell is genetically identical to the others. All the cells in our body (except the gametes) are formed by mitosis from the zygote (single cell formed at fertilisation). They all, therefore, contain copies of all the chromosomes and genes of that zygote. They are all genetically identical.

Whenever cells need to be replaced in our bodies, cells divide by mitosis to make them. This happens more frequently in some regions than in others.

- The skin loses thousands of cells every time we touch something. This adds up to millions every day that need replacing. A layer of cells beneath the surface is constantly dividing to produce replacements.
- Cells are scraped off the lining of the gut as food passes along. Again, a layer of cells beneath the gut lining is constantly dividing to produce replacement cells.
- Cells in our spleen destroy worn out red blood cells at the rate of 100 000 000 000 per day! These are replaced by cells in the bone marrow dividing by mitosis. In addition, the bone marrow forms all our new white blood cells and platelets.
- Cancer cells also divide by mitosis. The cells formed are exact copies of the parent cell, including the mutation in the genes that makes the cells divide uncontrollably.

## MEIOSIS

Meiosis forms gametes. It is a more complex process than mitosis and takes place in two stages called meiosis I and meiosis II, resulting in four haploid cells. Each daughter cell is genetically different from the other three and from the parent cell.

During meiosis the parent cell must do two things:
- It must copy each chromosome so that there is enough genetic material to be shared between the four daughter cells
- It must divide twice, in such a way that each daughter cell receives just one chromosome from each homologous pair.

These processes are summarised in Figure 17.4. Figure 17.3 shows cells in the anther of a flower dividing by meiosis.

                                          There are two main events during meiosis:
                                             during the first division, one chromosome from each homologous pair goes
                                             into each daughter cell
                                             during the second division; the chromosome separates into two parts. One
                                             part goes into each daughter cell:

                                          pairs. This allows for much possible genetic variation in the daughter cells
                                          (Figure 17.5).

## VARIATION AND SELECTION

### CELL DIVISION

A cell with three pairs of homologous chromosomes - A₁ and A₂, B₁ and B₂ and C₁ and C₂. The two chromosomes in each homologous pair contain different alleles for some of the genes.

[Diagram showing meiosis process with chromosome combinations]

As a result of the two divisions of meiosis, each sex cell formed contains one chromosome from each homologous pair. This gives eight combinations. As A₁ and A₂ contain different alleles (as do B₁ and B₂, and C₁ and C₂) the eight possible sex cells will be genetically different.

▲ Figure 17.5 How meiosis produces variation

### EXTENSION WORK

There is a mathematical rule for predicting how many combinations of chromosomes there can be. The rule is:

number of possible combinations = 2ⁿ

where n = number of pairs of chromosomes.

With two pairs of chromosomes, the number of possible combinations = 2² = 4. With three pairs of chromosomes, the number of possible combinations = 2³ = 8. With the 23 pairs of chromosomes in human cells, the number of possible combinations = 2²³ = 8 388 608!

Table 17.1 summarises the similarities and differences between mitosis and meiosis.

Table 17.1 Comparison of meiosis and mitosis.

| Feature of the process | Mitosis | Meiosis |
|------------------------|---------|---------|
| Chromosomes are copied before division begins | Yes | Yes |
| Number of cell divisions | One | Two |
| Number of daughter cells produced | Two | Four |
| Daughter cells are haploid or diploid | Diploid | Haploid |
| Genetic variation in the daughter cells | No | Yes |

### SEXUAL REPRODUCTION AND VARIATION

Sexual reproduction in any multicellular organism involves the fusion of two gametes to form a zygote. The offspring from sexual reproduction vary genetically for a number of reasons. One reason is because of the huge variation in the gametes. Another reason is because of the random way in which fertilisation takes place. In humans, any one of the billions of sperm formed by a male during his life could, potentially, fertilise any one of the thousands of ova formed by a female.

This variation applies to both male and female gametes. So, just using our 'low' estimate of about 8.5 million different types of human gametes means that there can be 8.5 million different types of sperm and 8.5 million different types of ova. When fertilisation takes place, any sperm could fertilise any ovum. The number of possible combinations of chromosomes (and genes) in the zygote is 8.5 million × 8.5 million = 7.2 × 10¹³, or 72 trillion! And remember, this is using our 'low' number!

This means that every individual is likely to be genetically unique. The only exceptions are identical twins. Identical twins are formed from the same zygote – they are sometimes called monozygotic twins. When the zygote divides by mitosis, the two genetically identical cells formed do not 'stay together'. Instead, they separate and each cell behaves as though it were an individual zygote, dividing and developing into an embryo (Figure 17.6). Because they have developed from genetically identical cells (and, originally, from the same

▲ Figure 17.6 How identical twins are formed

# VARIATION AND SELECTION

## CELL DIVISION

zygote), the embryos (and, later, the children and the adults they become) will be genetically identical.

Non-identical twins develop from different zygotes and so are not genetically identical.

Seeds are made by sexual reproduction in plants. Each seed contains an embryo, which results from a pollen grain nucleus fusing with an egg cell nucleus. Embryos from the same plant will vary genetically because they are formed by different pollen grains fertilising different egg cells and so contain different combinations of genes.

## ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION AND CLONING

### KEY POINT
Cloning is a process that produces a group of genetically identical offspring (a clone) from part of the parent organism. Gametes are not involved.

Plant breeders have known for a long time that sexual reproduction produces variation. They realised that if a plant had some desirable feature, the best way to get more of that plant was not to collect and plant its seeds, but to clone it in some way. Modern plant-breeding techniques allow the production of many thousands of identical plants from just a few cells of the original (see Chapter 19).

When organisms reproduce asexually, there is no fusion of gametes. A part of the organism grows and somehow breaks away from the parent organism. The cells it contains were formed by mitosis, so contain exactly the same genes as the parent. Asexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically identical to the parent, and genetically identical to each other.

Asexual reproduction is common in plants (see Chapter 13). For example, flower bulbs grow and divide asexually each season to produce more bulbs. Asexual reproduction also occurs in some animals (see Chapter 9).

## GENES AND ENVIRONMENT BOTH PRODUCE VARIATION

### DID YOU KNOW?
Short pea plants are called 'dwarf' varieties. The genetics controlling the height of pea plants is described in Chapter 18.

There are two varieties of pea plants that are either tall or short. This difference in height is due to the genes they inherit. There are no 'intermediate height' pea plants. However, all the tall pea plants are not exactly the same height and neither are all the short pea plants exactly the same height. Figure 17.7 illustrates the variation in height of pea plants.

| Characteristic | Left Distribution | Right Distribution |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Type of variation | Genetic | Genetic |
| Environmental influence | Variation due to environment | Variation due to environment |
| Distribution shape | Bell curve (normal distribution) | Bell curve (normal distribution) |
| Peak height | Higher | Lower |
| Spread | Narrower | Wider |

Figure 17.7 Bar chart showing variation in height of pea plants.

208 VARIATION AND SELECTION                 CELL DIVISION

Several environmental factors can influence the height of the plants.

- They may not all receive the same amount of light and so some will not photosynthesise as well as others.
- They may not all receive the same amount of water and mineral ions from the soil – this could affect the manufacture of a range of substances in the plant.
- They may not all receive the same amount of carbon dioxide. Again, some plants will not photosynthesise as well as others.

Similar principles apply in humans. Identical twins have the same genes, and often grow up to look very alike (although not quite identical). Also, they often develop similar talents. However, identical twins never look exactly the same. This is especially true if, for some reason, they grow up apart. The different environments affect their physical, social and intellectual development in different ways.
