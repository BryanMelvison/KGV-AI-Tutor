# 13 REPRODUCTION IN PLANTS

Plants, like animals, can reproduce sexually and asexually. The sexual organs of a flowering plant are its flowers, which produce pollen and ovules containing the flower's gametes. This chapter looks at both types of reproduction in flowering plants.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

- Describe the differences between sexual and asexual reproduction in plants
- Understand that plants can reproduce asexually by natural methods (illustrated by runners) and by artificial methods (illustrated by cuttings)
- Describe the structures of an insect-pollinated and a wind-pollinated flower and explain how each is adapted for pollination
- Understand that the growth of the pollen tube followed by fertilisation leads to seed and fruit formation
- Understand how germinating seeds utilise food reserves until the seedling can carry out photosynthesis
- Investigate the conditions needed for seed germination

## SEXUAL AND ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION

You have seen how animals can reproduce sexually and asexually (Chapter 9). Plants can also carry out both types of reproduction. Table 13.1 summarises some of the differences between the two methods of reproduction.

Table 13.1 Sexual and asexual reproduction compared.

| Feature of the process | Sexual reproduction | Asexual reproduction |
|------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| gametes produced | yes | no |
| fertilisation takes place | yes | no |
| genetic variation in offspring | yes | no |
| has survival value in: | changing environment | stable environment |

## KEY POINT

As each method of asexual reproduction involves some part of the plant growing, new cells must be produced. These cells are produced by mitosis and so are all genetically identical. This means that all the offspring formed by asexual reproduction will also be genetically identical.

## ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN PLANTS

There are many different methods of asexual reproduction in plants. Most involve some part of the plant growing, and then breaking away from the parent plant before developing into a new plant (Figure 13.1).

Gardeners often take advantage of the ways that plants can reproduce asexually. They use runners, bulbs and tubers to produce more plants.

## REPRODUCTION IN PLANTS

### Figure 13.1 Some methods of asexual reproduction in plants

1. Runner reproduction:
   - A new plant is produced where the runner touches the ground.
   - Shows parent plant with runner extending to form a new plant at ground level.

2. Potato tuber reproduction:
   - Potato tubers form underground at the ends of branches from the main stem.
   - Each potato can produce several new plants from the 'eyes' which are buds.

3. Bulb reproduction:
   - Some plants form bulbs. They are the bases of leaves which have become swollen with food.
   - Buds in them can develop into new plants.
   - Plants can form more than one bulb.
   - Image shows a bulb with a second bulb formed and roots.

Another type of asexual reproduction is to grow plants from cuttings. A piece of a plant's stem, with a few leaves attached, is cut from a healthy plant. This is planted in damp soil or compost, where it will grow roots and develop into a new plant (Figure 13.2).

### Figure 13.2 These geranium cuttings have started to grow roots
(Image shows three small potted plants with visible roots growing)

## SEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN PLANTS

> Haploid cells have only half the number of chromosomes of other body cells of that species.

Plants produce specialised, haploid gametes in their flowers. The male gametes are contained within the pollen grains and the female gametes are egg cells or ova. Just as in animals, the male gametes must be transferred to the female gametes. This takes place through pollination, which is normally carried out either by wind or insects. Following pollination, fertilisation takes place and the zygote formed develops into a seed, which, in turn, becomes enclosed in a fruit.

### PRODUCTION OF GAMETES AND POLLINATION

The gametes are produced by meiosis in structures in the flowers. Pollen grains are produced in the anthers of the stamens. The ova are produced in ovules in the ovaries.

In pollination, pollen grains are transferred from the anthers of a flower to the stigma. If this occurs within the same flower it is called self-pollination. If the pollen grains are transferred to a different flower, it is called cross-pollination. Pollination can occur by wind or by insect in either case.
---
Plants that are wind-pollinated produce flowers with a different structure to those of insect-pollinated flowers. These differences are related to the different methods of pollination of the flowers. Figure 13.3 shows the structure of a typical insect-pollinated flower and Figure 13.4 shows the structure of a typical wind-pollinated flower. Table 13.2 summarises the main differences between insect-pollinated flowers and wind-pollinated flowers.

![Figure 13.3 The main structures in an insect-pollinated flower.]

![Figure 13.4 The main structures in a wind-pollinated flower.]

Table 13.2 Differences between insect-pollinated and wind-pollinated flowers.

| Feature of flower | Type of flower |  |
|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| | Insect-pollinated | Wind-pollinated |
| position of stamens | enclosed within flower so that insect must make contact | exposed so that wind can easily blow pollen away |
| position of stigma | enclosed within flower so that insect must make contact | exposed to catch pollen blowing in the wind |
| type of stigma | sticky so pollen grains attach from insects | feathery, to catch pollen grains blowing in the wind |
| size of petals | large to attract insects | small |
| colour of petals | brightly coloured to attract insects | not brightly coloured, usually green |
| nectaries | present - they produce nectar, a sweet liquid containing sugars as a 'reward' for insects | absent |
| pollen grains | larger, sticky grains or grains with hooks, to stick to insects' bodies | smaller, smooth, inflated grains to carry in the wind |

## FERTILISATION

Pollination transfers the pollen grain to the stigma. However, for fertilisation to take place, the nucleus of the pollen grain (the male gamete) must fuse with the nucleus of the ovum, which is inside an ovule in the ovary. To transfer the nucleus to the ovum, the pollen grain forms a pollen tube, which grows down through the tissue of the style and into the ovary. Here it curves around to enter the opening in an ovule. The tip of the tube dissolves and allows the pollen grain nucleus to move out of the tube and into the ovule. Here it fertilises the ovum nucleus. These events are summarised in Figure 13.5.
---

### SEED AND FRUIT FORMATION

Once fertilisation has occurred, a number of changes take place in the ovule and ovary that will lead to the fertilised ovule becoming a seed and the ovary in which it is found becoming a fruit. Different flowers produce different types of fruits, but in all cases the following four changes take place.

1. The zygote develops into an embryonic plant with small root (radicle) and shoot (plumule).

2. Other contents of the ovule develop into a food store for the young plant when the seed germinates.

3. The ovule wall becomes the seed coat or testa.

4. The ovary wall becomes the fruit coat; this can take many forms depending on the type of fruit.

Figure 13.6 summarises these changes as they occur in the plum flower, which forms a fleshy fruit.

#### DID YOU KNOW?

Any structure that contains seeds is a fruit. A pea pod is a fruit. The 'pod' is the fruit wall, formed from the ovary wall, and the peas are individual seeds. Each forms from a fertilised ovule.

# BIOLOGY UNIT 4
# ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT

Ecology is the scientific study of the interactions between organisms and their surroundings. It analyses the interactions that living things have with each other and with their non-living, physical environment. In Chapter 14 we look at the components of ecosystems and these interactions. The activities of humans are having many serious effects on the world ecosystems, in particular as a consequence of agricultural practices and industrial pollution. Chapter 15 looks at these activities and considers how humans are damaging the planet.
