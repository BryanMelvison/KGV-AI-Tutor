# 9 REPRODUCTION IN HUMANS

One of the characteristics of living organisms that makes them different from non-living things is their ability to produce offspring, or reproduce. Reproduction is all about an organism passing on its genes. This can be through special sex cells, or gametes. It can also be asexually, without the production of gametes. In this chapter we look at the differences between sexual and asexual reproduction, and study in detail the process of human reproduction.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

- Understand the differences between sexual and asexual reproduction
- Understand that fertilisation involves the fusion of a male and female gamete to produce a zygote
- Understand that a zygote undergoes cell division and develops into an embryo
- Understand how the structure and function of the human male and female reproductive systems are adapted for their functions
- Describe the role of the placenta in the nutrition of the developing embryo
- Understand how the developing embryo is protected by amniotic fluid
- Understand the roles of oestrogen and testosterone in the development of secondary sexual characteristics
- Understand the roles of oestrogen and progesterone in the menstrual cycle

## SEXUAL AND ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION COMPARED

In any method of reproduction, the end result is the production of more organisms of the same species. Humans produce more humans, pea plants produce more pea plants and salmonella bacteria produce more salmonella bacteria. However, the way in which they reproduce differs. There are two types of reproduction: sexual reproduction and asexual reproduction.

In sexual reproduction, specialised sex cells called gametes are produced. There are usually two types, a mobile male gamete called a sperm and a stationary female gamete called an egg cell or ovum (plural ova).

The sperm must move to the egg and fuse (join) with it. This is called fertilisation (Figure 9.1). The single cell formed by fertilisation is called a zygote. This cell will divide many times by mitosis to form all the cells of the new animal.

In asexual reproduction, there are no specialised gametes and there is no fertilisation. Instead, cells in one part of the body divide by mitosis to form a structure that breaks away from the parent body and grows into a new organism. Not many animals reproduce in this way. Figure 9.2 shows Hydra (a small animal similar to jellyfish) reproducing by budding. Cells in the body wall divide to form a small version of the adult. This eventually breaks off and becomes a free-living Hydra. One animal may produce several 'buds' in a short space of time.

**KEY POINT**
Individuals produced asexually from the same adult organism are called clones.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: REPRODUCTION IN HUMANS

## KEY POINT

A gene is a section of DNA that determines a particular characteristic or feature. Genes are found in the nucleus of a cell on the chromosomes (see Chapter 18).

All the offspring produced from Hydra buds are genetically identical – they have exactly the same genes. This is because all the cells of the new individual are produced by mitosis from just one cell in the body of the adult. When cells divide by mitosis, the new cells that are produced are exact copies of the original cell (see Chapter 17 for a description of mitosis). As a result, all the cells of an organism that are produced asexually have the same genes as the cell that produced them – the original adult cell. So all asexually produced offspring from one adult will have the same genes as the cells of the adult. They will all be genetic copies of that adult and so will be identical to each other.

Asexual reproduction is useful to a species when the environment in which it lives is relatively stable. If an organism is well adapted to this stable environment, asexual reproduction will produce offspring that are also well adapted. However, if the environment changes significantly, then all the individuals will be affected equally by the change. It may be such a dramatic change that none of the individuals are adapted well enough to survive. The species will die out in that area.

## SEXUAL REPRODUCTION

There are four stages in any method of sexual reproduction:

- Gametes (sperm and egg cells) are produced.
- The male gamete (sperm) is transferred to the female gamete (egg cell).
- Fertilisation must occur – the sperm fuses with the egg.
- The zygote formed develops into a new individual.

The offspring produced by sexual reproduction show a great deal of genetic variation as a result of both gamete production and fertilisation.

## PRODUCTION OF GAMETES

Sperm are produced in the male sex organs – the testes. Eggs are produced in the female sex organs – the ovaries. Both are produced when cells inside these organs divide. These cells do not divide by mitosis but by meiosis (see Chapter 17). Meiosis produces cells that are not genetically identical and have only half the number of chromosomes as the original cell.

### KEY POINT

Cells that have the full number of chromosomes are called diploid cells. Cells that only have half the normal number of chromosomes are called haploid cells.

## TRANSFER OF THE SPERM TO THE EGG

Sperm are specialised for swimming. They have a tail-like flagellum that moves them through a fluid. Figure 9.3 shows the structure of a sperm.

Some male animals, such as those of most fish, release their sperm into the water in which they live. The female animals release their eggs into the water and the sperm then swim through the water to fertilise the eggs. This is called external fertilisation as it takes place outside the body. Before the release takes place, there is usually some mating behaviour to ensure that male and female are in the same place at the same time. This gives the best chance of fertilisation occurring before water currents sweep the sex cells away.

                                              genes.

                                        around and different shaped structures are formed. Also, different cells
                                        specialise to become bone cells, nerve cells  muscle cells, and so on (the
                                        process called differentiation):

                                          REPRODUCTION IN HUMANS
                                        Humans reproduce sexually and fertilisation is internal. Figures 9.6 and 9.7
                                        show the structure of the human female and male reproductive systems_
                                        The sperm are produced in the testes by meiosis. During sexual intercourse,
                                        they pass along the sperm duct and are mixed with a fluid from the seminal
                                        vesicles_ This mixture, called semen, is ejaculated through the urethra into
                                        the vagina of the female. The sperm then begin to swim towards the oviducts:

Each month, an egg is released into an oviduct from one of the ovaries. (The oviduct is also known as the Fallopian tube.) This is called ovulation. If an egg is present in the oviduct, then it may be fertilised by sperm introduced during intercourse. The zygote formed will begin to develop into an embryo, which will implant in the lining of the uterus. Here, the embryo will develop a placenta, which will allow the embryo to obtain materials such as oxygen and nutrients from the mother's blood. It also allows the embryo to get rid of waste products such as urea and carbon dioxide, as well as anchoring the embryo in the uterus. The placenta secretes female hormones, in particular progesterone, which maintain the pregnancy and prevent the embryo from aborting (being rejected by the mother's body). Figure 9.8 shows the structure and position of the placenta.

During pregnancy, a membrane called the amnion encloses the developing embryo. The amnion secretes a fluid called amniotic fluid, which protects the developing embryo against sudden movements and bumps. As the embryo develops, it becomes more and more complex. When it becomes recognisably human, we no longer call it an embryo but a fetus. At the end of nine months of development, there just isn't any room left for the fetus to grow and it sends a hormonal 'signal' to the mother to begin the birth process. Figure 9.8 also shows the position of a human fetus just before birth.

There are three stages to the birth of a child:

1. Dilation of the cervix. The cervix is the 'neck' of the uterus. It gets wider to allow the baby to pass through. The muscles of the uterus contract quite strongly and tears the amnion, allowing the amniotic fluid to escape. (In some countries the woman describes this as 'her waters have broken'.)

2. Delivery of the baby. Strong contractions of the muscles of the uterus push the baby's head through the cervix and then through the vagina to the outside world.

3. Delivery of the afterbirth. After the baby has been born, the uterus continues to contract and pushes the placenta out, together with the membranes that surrounded the baby. These are known as the afterbirth.

Figure 9.9 shows the stages of birth.

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Baby's head pushes cervix; mucous plug dislodges and waters break. |
| 2 | Uterus contracts to push baby out through the vagina. |
| 3 | The placenta becomes detached from the wall of the uterus and is expelled through the vagina as the afterbirth. |

## HORMONES CONTROLLING REPRODUCTION

Most animals are unable to reproduce when they are young. We say that they are sexually immature. When a baby is born, it is recognisable as a boy or girl by its sex organs.

The presence of male or female sex organs is known as the primary sex characteristics. During their teens, changes happen to boys and girls that lead to sexual maturity. These changes are controlled by hormones, and the time when they happen is called puberty. Puberty involves two developments. The first is that the gametes (eggs and sperm) start to mature and be released. The second is that the bodies of both sexes adapt to allow reproduction to take place. These events are started by hormones released by the pituitary gland.

In boys, these pituitary hormones stimulate sperm production and instruct the testes to secrete the male sex hormone, testosterone. Testosterone controls the development of the male secondary sexual characteristics. These include growth of the penis and testes, growth of facial and body hair, muscle

> DID YOU KNOW?
> 
> Just before birth, the fetus takes up so much room that many of the mother's organs are moved out of position. The heart is pushed upwards and rotates so that the base points towards the left breast.

> DID YOU KNOW?
> 
> Sperm production is most efficient at a temperature of about 34 °C, just below the core body temperature (37 °C). This is why the testes are outside the body in the scrotum, where the temperature is a little lower.

                                                  In girls, the pituitary hormones control the release of a female sex hormone
                                                  called oestrogen; from the ovaries. Oestrogen produces the female

                                                  The age when puberty takes place can vary a lot; but it is usually between
                                                  about 11 and 14 years in girls and 13 and 16 years in boys. It takes several
                                                  years for puberty to be completed. Some of the most complex changes take
                                                  place in girls, with the start of menstruation_

                                       uterus (womb); so that if the egg is fertilised, the lining will be ready to receive
                                       the fertilised egg: If the egg is not fertilised, the lining of the uterus is lost from
                                       the woman's body as the flow of menstrual blood and cells of the lining, called
                                        a period.
                                        A cycle is a continuous process, so it doesn't really have a beginning; but the
                                       first day of menstruation is usually called day 1.
                                       Inside a woman's ovaries are hundreds of thousands of cells that could
                                       develop into mature eggs. Every month; one of these grows inside a ball of
                                       cells called a follicle (Figure 9.12). At the middle of the  (about day 14)
                                                                                              cycle
                                       the follicle moves towards the edge of the ovary and the egg is released as
                                       the follicle bursts open. This is the moment of ovulation:
DID YOU KNOW?
 A small percentage of women
are able to sense the exact
moment that ovulation happens;
as the egg bursts out of anovary:

                                          Figure 9.12 Eggs developing inside the follicles of an ovary: The large follicle contains a fully
                                          developed egg ready for ovulation.
---
While this is going on, the lining of the uterus has been repaired after menstruation, and has thickened. This change is brought about by the hormone oestrogen, which is secreted by the ovaries.

After the egg has been released, it travels down the oviduct to the uterus. It is here in the oviduct that fertilisation may happen, if sexual intercourse has taken place. What's left of the follicle now forms a structure in the ovary called the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum makes another hormone called progesterone. Progesterone completes the development of the uterus lining, by thickening and maintaining it, ready for the fertilised egg to sink into it and develop into an embryo.

If the egg is not fertilised, the corpus luteum breaks down and stops making progesterone. The lining of the uterus then passes out through the woman's vagina during menstruation. If, however, the egg is fertilised, the corpus luteum carries on making progesterone, the lining is not shed, and menstruation doesn't happen. The first sign that tells a woman she is pregnant is when her monthly periods stop. Later on in pregnancy, the placenta secretes progesterone, taking over the role of the corpus luteum.

## EXTENSION WORK

'Corpus luteum' is Latin for 'yellow body'. A corpus luteum appears as a large yellow swelling in an ovary after the egg has been released.

# BIOLOGY UNIT 3
# PLANT PHYSIOLOGY

Plant physiology is the branch of biology that deals with the internal activities of plants. It covers many aspects of plant life, including nutrition (photosynthesis), movement of materials around the plant, and reproduction. There are many reasons why we need to study how plants work, not least because they provide the world's food supply and oxygen. Animals, including humans, could not exist without plants. Modern agriculture depends on the scientific study of plant physiology, as does our understanding of ecosystems.
