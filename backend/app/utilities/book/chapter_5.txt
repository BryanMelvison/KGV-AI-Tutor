# BLOOD AND CIRCULATION

## INTRODUCTION
LARGE MULTICELLULAR ANIMALS REQUIRE A CIRCULATORY SYSTEM TO TRANSPORT SUBSTANCES BETWEEN CELLS. THIS CHAPTER EXAMINES THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF HUMAN AND ANIMAL CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS, BLOOD COMPOSITION, AND HEART-RELATED DISORDERS.

## THE NEED FOR CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS
BLOOD CIRCULATES THROUGH A CLOSED SYSTEM COMPRISING THE HEART AND VESSELS. IT COLLECTS MATERIALS FROM CERTAIN AREAS AND DELIVERS THEM ELSEWHERE. IN MAMMALS, BLOOD PERFORMS SEVERAL CRITICAL FUNCTIONS:
- **OXYGEN TRANSPORT**: DELIVERS OXYGEN FROM LUNGS TO BODY TISSUES.
- **CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL**: TRANSPORTS CARBON DIOXIDE BACK TO THE LUNGS FROM TISSUES.
- **NUTRIENT DISTRIBUTION**: DELIVERS NUTRIENTS FROM THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM TO CELLS.
- **WASTE REMOVAL**: TRANSPORTS UREA FROM THE LIVER TO KIDNEYS FOR EXCRETION.
- **HORMONAL TRANSPORT**: CARRIES HORMONES, ANTIBODIES, AND ESSENTIAL SUBSTANCES.
- **HEAT DISTRIBUTION**: ASSISTS IN BODY HEAT DISPERSION.

## CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS IN UNICELLULAR ORGANISMS
UNICELLULAR ORGANISMS LACK A CIRCULATORY SYSTEM; INSTEAD, THEY RELY ON DIFFUSION FOR SUBSTANCE MOVEMENT, AS ILLUSTRATED IN FIGURE 5.2.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: BLOOD AND CIRCULATION

## INTRODUCTION TO CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS

THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM IS ESSENTIAL FOR TRANSPORTING OXYGEN AND NUTRIENTS THROUGHOUT THE BODY. DIFFERENT ORGANISMS HAVE EVOLVED VARIOUS TYPES OF CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS TAILORED TO THEIR PHYSIOLOGICAL NEEDS.

### UNICELLULAR ORGANISMS

UNICELLULAR ORGANISMS, SUCH AS AMOEBA, EUGLENA, AND PARAMECIUM, LACK A CIRCULATORY SYSTEM. INSTEAD, THEY RELY ON DIFFUSION TO MOVE MATERIALS WITHIN THEIR BODIES. THESE ORGANISMS OBTAIN OXYGEN THROUGH DIFFUSION ACROSS THEIR SURFACE MEMBRANE. THE EFFICIENCY OF THIS PROCESS IS DETERMINED BY THEIR HIGH SURFACE AREA TO VOLUME RATIO.

- **SURFACE AREA**: DETERMINES THE SUPPLY RATE OF OXYGEN.
- **VOLUME**: DETERMINES THE DEMAND RATE FOR OXYGEN.

THE RATIO OF SUPPLY TO DEMAND CAN BE EXPRESSED AS:

\[ \TEXT{SURFACE AREA} : \TEXT{VOLUME} \]

SINGLE-CELLED ORGANISMS BENEFIT FROM THIS HIGH RATIO, ALLOWING EFFICIENT OXYGEN ACQUISITION. IN CONTRAST, LARGER ANIMALS HAVE A LOWER SURFACE AREA TO VOLUME RATIO, MAKING DIFFUSION INSUFFICIENT FOR THEIR NEEDS.

### CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS IN LARGER ANIMALS

LARGER ANIMALS CANNOT RELY SOLELY ON DIFFUSION. THEY HAVE EVOLVED SPECIALIZED GAS EXCHANGE ORGANS AND CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS. FOR EXAMPLE:

- **FISH** USE GILLS FOR GAS EXCHANGE.
- **MAMMALS** UTILIZE LUNGS FOR OXYGEN INTAKE.

THESE ORGANS ARE CONNECTED TO A CIRCULATORY SYSTEM THAT TRANSPORTS OXYGEN TO ALL BODY PARTS.

### TYPES OF CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS

THERE ARE TWO PRIMARY TYPES OF CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS IN ANIMALS:

1. **SINGLE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM**: BLOOD IS PUMPED FROM THE HEART TO GAS EXCHANGE ORGANS AND THEN DIRECTLY DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE BODY.

2. **DOUBLE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM**: BLOOD FLOWS FROM THE HEART TO GAS EXCHANGE ORGANS, RETURNS TO THE HEART, AND IS THEN CIRCULATED TO THE REST OF THE BODY.

**FIGURE 5.3** ILLUSTRATES THESE DIFFERENCES, HIGHLIGHTING THE STRUCTURAL VARIATIONS BETWEEN SINGLE AND DOUBLE CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS.

### CONCLUSION

THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM IS VITAL FOR OXYGEN AND NUTRIENT TRANSPORT IN ANIMALS. UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN UNICELLULAR ORGANISMS AND LARGER ANIMALS UNDERSCORES THE COMPLEXITY AND ADAPTABILITY OF BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS. THIS KNOWLEDGE IS FUNDAMENTAL TO APPRECIATING HOW ORGANISMS FUNCTION IN DIVERSE ENVIRONMENTS.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: BLOOD AND CIRCULATION

## KEY POINT
**PULMONARY** REFERS TO PROCESSES INVOLVING THE LUNGS.

## FACT
THERE ARE TWO VENA CAVAE IN THE HUMAN BODY. ONE TRANSPORTS BLOOD FROM THE HEAD AND ARMS, WHILE THE OTHER RETURNS BLOOD FROM THE REST OF THE BODY.

---

### BLOOD AND CIRCULATION

THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM IS CRUCIAL FOR TRANSPORTING BLOOD THROUGHOUT THE BODY. ANIMALS HAVE TWO PRIMARY TYPES OF CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS: SINGLE AND DOUBLE.

#### SINGLE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
- FOUND IN FISH, THIS SYSTEM ALLOWS BLOOD TO FLOW THROUGH THE HEART ONLY ONCE PER COMPLETE CYCLE.
- AFTER OXYGENATION IN THE GILLS, BLOOD TRAVELS TO OTHER BODY PARTS.
- PRESSURE REDUCTION IN THE GILLS SLOWS BLOOD FLOW TO THESE AREAS.

#### DOUBLE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
- COMMON IN HUMANS AND MAMMALS, THIS SYSTEM INVOLVES TWO CIRCUITS:
  - **PULMONARY CIRCULATION**: DEOXYGENATED BLOOD LEAVES THE HEART VIA PULMONARY ARTERIES, OXYGENATES IN THE LUNGS, AND RETURNS THROUGH PULMONARY VEINS.
  - **SYSTEMIC CIRCULATION**: OXYGENATED BLOOD TRAVELS FROM THE HEART VIA THE AORTA TO BODY TISSUES, UNLOADING OXYGEN, AND RETURNS VIA VENA CAVAE.

### EFFICIENCY COMPARISON
THE DOUBLE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM IS MORE EFFICIENT:
- THE HEART PUMPS BLOOD TWICE, MAINTAINING HIGHER PRESSURES.
- BLOOD REACHES ORGANS FASTER, ENSURING EFFICIENT DELIVERY OF OXYGEN AND NUTRIENTS.

### COMPONENTS OF HUMAN CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
KEY COMPONENTS INCLUDE:
- **HEART**: ACTS AS THE PUMP.
- **BLOOD VESSELS**:
  - **ARTERIES**: CARRY BLOOD AWAY FROM THE HEART TO TISSUES.
  - **VEINS**: RETURN DEOXYGENATED BLOOD TO THE HEART.
  - **CAPILLARIES**: ENABLE OXYGEN AND NUTRIENT EXCHANGE BETWEEN ARTERIES AND VEINS.
- **BLOOD**: SERVES AS THE TRANSPORT MEDIUM FOR OXYGEN, NUTRIENTS, AND WASTE PRODUCTS.

### VISUAL REPRESENTATION
REFER TO FIGURES 5.3 (COMPARING FISH AND HUMAN SYSTEMS) AND 5.4 (HUMAN BLOOD VESSELS) FOR FURTHER DETAILS.

UNDERSTANDING THESE SYSTEMS HIGHLIGHTS HOW ANIMALS ADAPT TO THEIR ENVIRONMENTS AND MAINTAIN PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFICIENCY.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: BLOOD AND CIRCULATION

## THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE HUMAN HEART

THE HUMAN HEART FUNCTIONS AS A PUMP, CIRCULATING BLOOD THROUGHOUT THE BODY. IT IS LOCATED IN THE CHEST CAVITY, PROTECTED BY THE RIBCAGE. THE HEART'S ACTIVITY ADJUSTS BASED ON THE BODY'S NEEDS, VARYING IN RATE AND PRESSURE TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS.

### KEY COMPONENTS OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM

THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM CONSISTS OF A NETWORK OF VESSELS THAT FACILITATE THE MOVEMENT OF BLOOD. CENTRAL TO THIS SYSTEM IS THE HEART, WHICH PUMPS BLOOD THROUGH ARTERIES, VEINS, AND CAPILLARIES. THE AORTA, THE LARGEST ARTERY, CARRIES OXYGENATED BLOOD FROM THE LEFT VENTRICLE TO THE BODY. SIMILARLY, THE PULMONARY ARTERY TRANSPORTS DEOXYGENATED BLOOD FROM THE RIGHT VENTRICLE TO THE LUNGS VIA THE PULMONARY VEIN, WHICH THEN RETURNS OXYGENATED BLOOD TO THE LEFT ATRIUM. THE VENA CAVAE, INCLUDING THE SUPERIOR AND INFERIOR VARIETIES, PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN RETURNING DEOXYGENATED BLOOD TO THE RIGHT ATRIUM.

THE HEART'S CHAMBERS ARE ORGANIZED TO ENSURE EFFICIENT BLOOD CIRCULATION. THE RIGHT ATRIUM RECEIVES DEOXYGENATED BLOOD FROM THE BODY, WHILE THE RIGHT VENTRICLE PUMPS THIS BLOOD TO THE LUNGS. CONVERSELY, THE LEFT ATRIUM RECEIVES OXYGENATED BLOOD FROM THE LUNGS, AND THE LEFT VENTRICLE PUMPS THIS ENRICHED BLOOD THROUGHOUT THE BODY.

### HEART VALVES

VALVES WITHIN THE HEART REGULATE BLOOD FLOW, ENSURING IT MOVES IN A SINGLE DIRECTION. THE BICUSPID (MITRAL) VALVE IS LOCATED BETWEEN THE LEFT ATRIUM AND LEFT VENTRICLE, PREVENTING BACKFLOW. SIMILARLY, THE TRICUSPID VALVE ENSURES THAT BLOOD FLOWS ONLY FROM THE RIGHT ATRIUM TO THE RIGHT VENTRICLE. SEMILUNAR VALVES AT THE VENTRICULAR EXITS FURTHER SAFEGUARD AGAINST REGURGITATION.

THE BICUSPID AND TRICUSPID VALVES ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS ATRIOVENTRICULAR VALVES DUE TO THEIR ROLE IN CONTROLLING BLOOD FLOW BETWEEN ATRIA AND VENTRICLES. THESE MECHANISMS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR MAINTAINING PROPER CIRCULATION.

### FUN FACT

THE TERM "CARDIAC" ORIGINATES FROM THE LATIN WORD FOR HEART, HIGHLIGHTING ITS CENTRAL ROLE IN LIFE AND HEALTH.

UNDERSTANDING THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE HEART IS FUNDAMENTAL TO GRASPING HOW BLOOD CIRCULATES, DELIVERING OXYGEN AND NUTRIENTS WHILE REMOVING WASTE PRODUCTS.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: BLOOD AND CIRCULATION

BLOOD CIRCULATION IN THE BODY IS A VITAL PROCESS INVOLVING THE HEART'S CHAMBERS. THE HEART FUNCTIONS THROUGH CONTRACTIONS AND RELAXATIONS COLLECTIVELY KNOWN AS THE **CARDIAC CYCLE**.

## THE CARDIAC CYCLE

THE CARDIAC CYCLE CONSISTS OF SEVERAL KEY STAGES:

1. **ATRIAL FILLING**: BLOOD ENTERS THE ATRIA, WITH BICUSPID (MITRAL) AND TRICUSPID VALVES CLOSED TO PREVENT FLOW INTO THE VENTRICLES.

2. **ATRIAL CONTRACTION**: ATRIAL WALLS CONTRACT, INCREASING BLOOD PRESSURE AND FORCING OPEN THE VALVES, ALLOWING BLOOD TO FLOW INTO THE VENTRICLES.

3. **VENTRICULAR FILLING**: VENTRICLES FILL WITH BLOOD AS PRESSURE INCREASES.

4. **VENTRICULAR CONTRACTION**: WHEN FULL, VENTRICLES CONTRACT, INCREASING PRESSURE AND CLOSING THE VALVES TO PREVENT BLOOD FROM RETURNING TO THE ATRIA.

5. **BLOOD EJECTION**: INCREASED PRESSURE IN THE VENTRICLES FORCES OPEN SEMI-LUNAR VALVES, EJECTING BLOOD INTO THE PULMONARY ARTERY (TO THE LUNGS) AND THE AORTA (TO THE BODY).

6. **CYCLE REPETITION**: AS THE VENTRICLES EMPTY, HIGHER PRESSURE IN THE AORTA AND PULMONARY ARTERY CLOSES THEIR VALVES, RESTARTING THE CYCLE AS ATRIA REFILL.

## KEY FEATURES OF THE HEART

- **SEPTUM**: DIVIDES THE HEART INTO LEFT AND RIGHT SIDES. THE LEFT VENTRICLE PUMPS BLOOD TO THE BODY, REQUIRING MORE PRESSURE THAN THE RIGHT, WHICH ONLY PUMPS TO THE LUNGS.

- **VALVES**: ENSURE ONE-WAY BLOOD FLOW THROUGH BICUSPID (MITRAL) AND TRICUSPID VALVES IN ATRIOVENTRICULAR OPENINGS.

- **ATRIAL WALLS**: THIN WALLS ALLOW STRETCHING TO RECEIVE RETURNING BLOOD AND CONTRACTING WITH SUFFICIENT FORCE TO PUSH IT INTO VENTRICLES VIA CLOSED VALVES.

## CARDIAC MUSCLE

- **UNIQUE PROPERTIES**: UNLIKE SKELETAL MUSCLE, CARDIAC MUSCLE DOESN'T FATIGUE. IT CONTRACTS AND RELAXES ABOUT 70 TIMES A MINUTE, TOTALING OVER TWO BILLION CONTRACTIONS IN A LIFETIME WITHOUT REST.

- **BLOOD SUPPLY**: CORONARY CIRCULATION PROVIDES OXYGEN AND NUTRIENTS VIA CORONARY ARTERIES TO CAPILLARIES SUPPLYING THE HEART MUSCLE. BLOOD RETURNS THROUGH CORONARY VEINS TO THE RIGHT ATRIUM.

### KEY POINT
CARDIAC MUSCLE'S ABILITY TO CONTINUOUSLY CONTRACT WITHOUT FATIGUE IS CRUCIAL FOR MAINTAINING BLOOD CIRCULATION THROUGHOUT THE BODY.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: CORONARY HEART DISEASE

## UNDERSTANDING CORONARY HEART DISEASE (CHD)

CORONARY HEART DISEASE (CHD) OCCURS WHEN THE CORONARY ARTERIES, WHICH SUPPLY BLOOD TO THE HEART MUSCLE, BECOME BLOCKED. THIS BLOCKAGE IS OFTEN DUE TO A BUILD-UP OF FATTY SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING CHOLESTEROL, IN THE ARTERY WALLS. WHEN BLOOD FLOW IS CUT OFF TO A PART OF THE HEART MUSCLE, THAT AREA CANNOT RECEIVE OXYGEN AND GLUCOSE, LEADING TO HEART DAMAGE AND POTENTIALLY A HEART ATTACK.

### FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO CHD

SEVERAL FACTORS CAN INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF DEVELOPING CHD:

- **GENETIC PREDISPOSITION**: SOME INDIVIDUALS INHERIT A TENDENCY TO DEVELOP CHD.
- **HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE**: THIS CONDITION STRAINS THE HEART.
- **DIET**: CONSUMING LARGE AMOUNTS OF SATURATED FAT CAN RAISE CHOLESTEROL LEVELS.
- **SMOKING**: THIS HABIT RAISES BLOOD PRESSURE AND INCREASES THE RISK OF BLOOD CLOTS.
- **STRESS LEVELS**: ELEVATED STRESS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO HIGHER BLOOD PRESSURE.
- **LACK OF EXERCISE**: REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY HELPS REDUCE BLOOD PRESSURE AND STRENGTHENS THE HEART.

### THE IMPACT OF BLOCKED CORONARY ARTERIES

A BLOCKAGE IN A CORONARY ARTERY DEPRIVES A REGION OF THE HEART MUSCLE OF OXYGEN, LEADING TO POTENTIAL HEART DAMAGE. THIS IS ILLUSTRATED BY FIGURE 5.7, WHICH SHOWS HOW A BLOCKAGE AFFECTS BLOOD SUPPLY.

## HEART RATE AND ITS REGULATION

THE HEART TYPICALLY BEATS ABOUT 70 TIMES PER MINUTE. DURING EXERCISE, MUSCLES REQUIRE MORE ENERGY, INCREASING BOTH HEART RATE AND THE VOLUME OF BLOOD PUMPED WITH EACH BEAT (STROKE VOLUME) TO MEET OXYGEN DEMANDS.

### THE 'FIGHT OR FLIGHT' RESPONSE

EMOTIONS LIKE ANGER OR FEAR TRIGGER THE 'FIGHT OR FLIGHT' RESPONSE, CHARACTERIZED BY INCREASED HEART RATE DUE TO ADRENALINE SECRETION FROM THE ADRENAL GLANDS. THIS RESPONSE PREPARES THE BODY FOR ACTION BY SUPPLYING EXTRA BLOOD TO MUSCLES.

### HEART RATE DURING SLEEP

WHEN SLEEPING, HEART RATE DECREASES AS ORGAN FUNCTIONS SLOW DOWN, REQUIRING LESS ENERGY AND OXYGEN. THESE FLUCTUATIONS ARE CONTROLLED BY NERVE IMPULSES FROM THE MEDULLA.

## DID YOU KNOW?

DURING ANXIETY, YOU MIGHT FEEL A 'HOLLOW' OR 'FLUTTERING' SENSATION IN YOUR STOMACH. THIS OCCURS BECAUSE BLOOD IS REDIRECTED FROM THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM TO MUSCLES, PREPARING FOR THE 'FIGHT OR FLIGHT' RESPONSE.

---

UNDERSTANDING THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE HEART AND FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO CHD IS CRUCIAL FOR MAINTAINING CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH. REGULAR EXERCISE, BALANCED DIETS, AND STRESS MANAGEMENT CAN REDUCE CHD RISK.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: BLOOD AND CIRCULATION

## HEART RATE CONTROL

DURING EXERCISE, THE BODY PRODUCES MORE CARBON DIOXIDE THROUGH AEROBIC RESPIRATION. RECEPTORS LOCATED IN THE AORTA AND CAROTID ARTERY DETECT THIS INCREASE IN CARBON DIOXIDE LEVELS.

THESE RECEPTORS SEND ELECTRICAL SIGNALS, KNOWN AS NERVE IMPULSES, THROUGH THE SENSORY NERVE TO THE MEDULLA. THE MEDULLA RESPONDS BY SENDING NERVE IMPULSES ALONG THE ACCELERATOR NERVE. WHEN CARBON DIOXIDE PRODUCTION RETURNS TO NORMAL, THE MEDULLA RECEIVES FEWER IMPULSES AND SENDS NERVE IMPULSES ALONG THE DECELERATOR NERVE.

**KEY POINT:** THE REGION OF THE MEDULLA CONTROLLING HEART FUNCTIONS IS CALLED THE CARDIAC CENTER.

!FIGURE 5.8 ILLUSTRATES HOW HEART RATE IS CONTROLLED.

- THE **ACCELERATOR NERVE** INCREASES HEART RATE AND BLOOD PRESSURE BY ENHANCING CONTRACTIONS.
- THE **DECELERATOR NERVE** DECREASES HEART RATE AND REDUCES CONTRACTION FORCE, ALLOWING BLOOD PRESSURE TO RETURN TO NORMAL.

THESE CONTROLS ARE EXAMPLES OF REFLEX ACTIONS (SEE CHAPTER 6).

---

## BLOOD VESSELS: ARTERIES, VEINS, AND CAPILLARIES

### ARTERIES

ARTERIES CARRY OXYGENATED BLOOD FROM THE HEART TO BODY ORGANS. PUMPED BY VENTRICLES AT HIGH PRESSURE, ARTERIAL BLOOD IS DELIVERED THROUGH ELASTIC WALLS THAT STRETCH AND RECOIL, MAINTAINING HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. THE MUSCULAR WALLS OF ARTERIES CAN DILATE OR CONSTRICT, CONTROLLING BLOOD FLOW.

### VEINS

VEINS RETURN BLOOD TO THE HEART FROM BODY ORGANS. VENOUS BLOOD PRESSURE IS MUCH LOWER THAN ARTERIAL, RESULTING IN THINNER WALLS WITH LESS ELASTIC TISSUE AND MUSCLE COMPARED TO ARTERIES.

!FIGURE 5.9 SHOWS THE STRUCTURE OF A TYPICAL ARTERY AND VEIN WITH THE SAME DIAMETER.

---

UNDERSTANDING ARTERIES AND VEINS IS ESSENTIAL FOR GRASPING BLOOD CIRCULATION AND HEART REGULATION PROCESSES.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: BLOOD AND CIRCULATION

## ARTERIOLES
ARTERIOLES ARE SMALL ARTERIES THAT CARRY BLOOD INTO ORGANS FROM LARGER ARTERIES. THEIR WALLS CONTAIN A HIGHER PROPORTION OF MUSCLE FIBERS COMPARED TO LARGER ARTERIES, ENABLING EFFECTIVE REGULATION OF BLOOD FLOW. ARTERIOLES ALSO HAVE NERVE ENDINGS THAT ALLOW THEM TO DILATE OR CONSTRICT, CONTROLLING THE AMOUNT OF BLOOD ENTERING AN ORGAN.

IF ALL ARTERIOLES CONSTRICT, BLOOD PASSES THROUGH WITH INCREASED RESISTANCE, LEADING TO HIGHER BLOOD PRESSURE. PROLONGED STRESS CAN CAUSE ARTERIOLE CONSTRICTION, RESULTING IN ELEVATED BLOOD PRESSURE.

## BLOOD VESSELS

### ARTERIES AND VEINS
ARTERIES CARRY OXYGENATED BLOOD EXCEPT FOR THE PULMONARY ARTERY AND UMBILICAL ARTERY IN UNBORN BABIES. VEINS CARRY DEOXYGENATED BLOOD, EXCEPT FOR THE PULMONARY VEIN AND UMBILICAL VEIN. VEINS HAVE SEMILUNAR VALVES THAT PREVENT BACKFLOW OF BLOOD.

!FIGURE 5.9: CROSS-SECTIONAL STRUCTURES OF (A) AN ARTERY AND (B) A VEIN.

### CAPILLARIES
CAPILLARIES ARE TINY VESSELS FACILITATING SUBSTANCE EXCHANGE BETWEEN BLOOD AND CELLS. THEIR THIN WALLS ALLOW MATERIALS TO DIFFUSE EASILY, ENABLING OXYGEN, GLUCOSE, AMINO ACIDS, CARBON DIOXIDE, AND WASTE PRODUCTS TO BE TRANSFERRED EFFICIENTLY. RED BLOOD CELLS FIT THROUGH CAPILLARIES, ENSURING SHORT DIFFUSION DISTANCES FOR OXYGEN.

!FIGURE 5.11: CAPILLARY EXCHANGE WITH CELLS.

### BLOOD FLOW
IN CAPILLARIES, GLUCOSE AND WATER DIFFUSE FROM BLOOD INTO CELLS, WHILE WASTE PRODUCTS LIKE CARBON DIOXIDE MOVE FROM CELLS INTO THE BLOOD. THEIR STRUCTURE SUPPORTS EFFICIENT EXCHANGE DUE TO THIN WALLS AND SMALL DIAMETERS.

!FIGURE 5.12: COMPARING ARTERY AND VEIN LUMENS BY WALL THICKNESS.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: BLOOD AND CIRCULATION

## THE COMPOSITION OF BLOOD

BLOOD IS A COMPLEX LIQUID TISSUE COMPOSED OF VARIOUS COMPONENTS, EACH WITH DISTINCT FUNCTIONS. THESE COMPONENTS INCLUDE PLASMA, RED BLOOD CELLS (ERYTHROCYTES), WHITE BLOOD CELLS, PLATELETS, AND LYMPHOCYTES.

### TYPES OF BLOOD CELLS

FIGURE 5.13 ILLUSTRATES THE MAIN TYPES OF BLOOD CELLS:

- **RED BLOOD CELLS (ERYTHROCYTES)**: BICONCAVE, DISC-LIKE CELLS WITHOUT A NUCLEUS, FOUND IN MILLIONS PER CUBIC MILLIMETER OF BLOOD.
- **WHITE BLOOD CELLS**: INCLUDE LYMPHOCYTES AND PHAGOCYTES, WHICH PLAY CRUCIAL ROLES IN IMMUNE RESPONSES.

### FUNCTIONS OF BLOOD COMPONENTS

THE COMPONENTS OF BLOOD PERFORM SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS:

- **PLASMA**: THE LIQUID PORTION OF BLOOD, PRIMARILY WATER, RESPONSIBLE FOR TRANSPORTING NUTRIENTS, HORMONES, CARBON DIOXIDE, UREA, AND HEAT.
- **RED BLOOD CELLS (ERYTHROCYTES)**: TRANSPORT OXYGEN VIA HEMOGLOBIN, LOADING IT IN THE LUNGS AND UNLOADING IT ELSEWHERE IN THE BODY.
- **WHITE BLOOD CELLS**:
  - **LYMPHOCYTES**: PRODUCE ANTIBODIES TO COMBAT MICROORGANISMS AND PROVIDE IMMUNITY.
  - **PHAGOCYTES**: ENGAGE IN DESTROYING BACTERIA AND OTHER PATHOGENS.
- **PLATELETS**: FUNCTION AS FRAGMENTS OF CELLS THAT RELEASE CHEMICALS TO INITIATE BLOOD CLOTTING.

UNDERSTANDING THESE COMPONENTS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IS ESSENTIAL FOR GRASPING HOW THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM MAINTAINS HEALTH, RESPONDS TO INJURIES, AND FIGHTS INFECTIONS.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: BLOOD AND CIRCULATION

## RED BLOOD CELLS

RED BLOOD CELLS, KNOWN AS ERYTHROCYTES, ARE SPECIALIZED CELLS PRODUCED IN THE BONE MARROW. THEY HAVE A LIFESPAN OF APPROXIMATELY 100 DAYS BEFORE BEING DESTROYED IN THE SPLEEN. THE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF RED BLOOD CELLS IS TO TRANSPORT OXYGEN THROUGHOUT THE BODY. SEVERAL STRUCTURAL FEATURES ENABLE THIS EFFICIENT PROCESS:

- **HAEMOGLOBIN**: THESE CELLS CONTAIN HAEMOGLOBIN, AN IRON-PROTEIN THAT BINDS WITH OXYGEN TO FORM OXYHAEMOGLOBIN DURING HIGH-OXYGEN CONDITIONS. CONVERSELY, WHEN OXYGEN LEVELS ARE LOW, OXYHAEMOGLOBIN REVERTS TO HAEMOGLOBIN, ALLOWING THE CELL TO RELEASE STORED OXYGEN.

- **OXYGEN TRANSPORT**: RED BLOOD CELLS LOAD OXYGEN IN THE LUNGS AND DELIVER IT TO TISSUES DURING ACTIVE PERIODS.

- **NUCLEUS ABSENCE**: THE LACK OF A NUCLEUS IN RED BLOOD CELLS ALLOWS FOR MAXIMUM PRODUCTION OF HAEMOGLOBIN, ENHANCING OXYGEN TRANSPORT CAPACITY.

- **BICONCAVE SHAPE**: THIS SHAPE INCREASES THE CELL'S SURFACE AREA-TO-VOLUME RATIO, FACILITATING EFFICIENT OXYGEN DIFFUSION. THE THIN STRUCTURE ENSURES THAT OXYGEN REACHES THE CELL'S CENTER QUICKLY.

## WHITE BLOOD CELLS

WHITE BLOOD CELLS PLAY A CRUCIAL DEFENSIVE ROLE AGAINST PATHOGENS LIKE BACTERIA AND VIRUSES. THEY FUNCTION PRIMARILY THROUGH PHAGOCYTOSIS AND ANTIBODY PRODUCTION:

### PHAGOCYTOSIS

APPROXIMATELY 70% OF WHITE BLOOD CELLS ARE PHAGOCYTES, WHICH PROTECT THE BODY BY ENGULFING PATHOGENS:

- **SHAPE CHANGE**: PHAGOCYTES MORPH THEIR CELL MEMBRANES TO FORM PSEUDOPODIA, ENCLOSING PATHOGENS IN VACUOLES.

- **DIGESTION**: THE ENGULFED PATHOGEN IS BROKEN DOWN BY DIGESTIVE ENZYMES WITHIN THE VACUOLE, A PROCESS CALLED "CELL EATING."

### ANTIBODY PRODUCTION

ABOUT 25% OF WHITE BLOOD CELLS ARE LYMPHOCYTES, RESPONSIBLE FOR GENERATING ANTIBODIES. THESE SOLUBLE PROTEINS RECOGNIZE PATHOGENS BASED ON THEIR SURFACE ANTIGENS:

- **CLUMPING PATHOGENS**: ANTIBODIES CAUSE BACTERIA TO AGGREGATE, FACILITATING PHAGOCYTOSIS.

- **LABELING PATHOGENS**: THEY ACT AS MARKERS FOR EASIER RECOGNITION BY PHAGOCYTES.

- **LYSIS**: ANTIBODIES CAN CAUSE BACTERIAL CELLS TO BURST OPEN.

- **NEUTRALIZATION**: TOXINS PRODUCED BY PATHOGENS ARE NEUTRALIZED, PREVENTING HARM.

THE INITIAL ANTIBODY RESPONSE FOLLOWING ANTIGEN EXPOSURE IS KNOWN AS THE PRIMARY IMMUNE RESPONSE.

---

## SKILLS: REASONING

1. ONE ANIMAL WITH A SINGLE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM IS THE:
   - EXAMPLE: FISH

2. AN ANIMAL WITH A DOUBLE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM IS THE:
   - EXAMPLE: MAMMALS

3. A DOUBLE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM ALLOWS FOR HIGHER BLOOD PRESSURE AND MORE EFFICIENT DELIVERY OF OXYGEN AND NUTRIENTS, AS WELL AS BETTER REMOVAL OF CARBON DIOXIDE AND WASTE PRODUCTS.

4. SINGLE-CELLED ORGANISMS DO NOT NEED A CIRCULATORY SYSTEM BECAUSE THEY RELY ON DIFFUSION ACROSS THEIR CELL MEMBRANE FOR NUTRIENT AND WASTE TRANSPORT, WHICH IS EFFICIENT DUE TO THEIR LARGE SURFACE AREA RELATIVE TO VOLUME.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: BLOOD AND CIRCULATION

## BLOOD'S ROLE IN TRANSPORT

BLOOD IS ESSENTIAL FOR TRANSPORTING OXYGEN AND CARBON DIOXIDE THROUGHOUT THE BODY.

### OXYGEN TRANSPORT
OXYGEN IS CARRIED BY RED BLOOD CELLS, WHICH HAVE SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS TO FACILITATE THIS FUNCTION. THESE INCLUDE A BICONCAVE SHAPE, NO NUCLEUS, AND A FLEXIBLE MEMBRANE, ALLOWING EFFICIENT OXYGEN ABSORPTION AND DELIVERY.

THE PROCESS OF OXYGEN TRANSPORT INVOLVES TWO MAIN STEPS: ITS ENTRY INTO RED BLOOD CELLS FROM ALVEOLI IN THE LUNGS THROUGH DIFFUSION AND ITS SUBSEQUENT RELEASE TO ACTIVELY RESPIRING MUSCLE CELLS VIA DIFFUSION.

### CARBON DIOXIDE TRANSPORT
CARBON DIOXIDE IS TRANSPORTED IN THREE PRIMARY WAYS: DISSOLVED IN PLASMA, BOUND TO HEMOGLOBIN IN RED BLOOD CELLS, AND AS BICARBONATE IONS (HCO3-) IN PLASMA. THESE MECHANISMS ENSURE EFFICIENT REMOVAL OF CARBON DIOXIDE FROM THE BODY.

## BLOOD VESSELS: ARTERIES, VEINS, AND CAPILLARIES

### ARTERIES
ARTERIES HAVE THICK MUSCULAR WALLS AND NARROW LUMENS TO WITHSTAND HIGH PRESSURE, FACILITATING EFFICIENT BLOOD DELIVERY FROM THE HEART.

### VEINS
VEINS DIFFER FROM ARTERIES IN HAVING THINNER WALLS, LARGER LUMENS, AND VALVES THAT PREVENT BACKFLOW, AIDING IN THE RETURN OF BLOOD TO THE HEART.

### CAPILLARIES
CAPILLARIES ARE ONE CELL THICK, FORMING AN EXTENSIVE NETWORK FOR EFFICIENT GAS AND NUTRIENT EXCHANGE BETWEEN TISSUES AND BLOOD.

## THE HUMAN HEART

THE HEART'S STRUCTURE INCLUDES FOUR CHAMBERS: THE RIGHT ATRIUM (A), RIGHT VENTRICLE (B), LEFT ATRIUM (C), AND LEFT VENTRICLE (D). THE AORTA (E) IS THE MAIN ARTERY EXITING THE LEFT VENTRICLE.

### FUNCTION OF HEART CHAMBERS
- THE RIGHT VENTRICLE (B) PUMPS DEOXYGENATED BLOOD TO THE LUNGS.
- THE LEFT VENTRICLE (D) PUMPS OXYGENATED BLOOD TO THE BODY.

BLOOD RETURNS TO THE HEART FROM THE LUNGS VIA THE LEFT ATRIUM (C) AND FROM OTHER ORGANS VIA THE RIGHT ATRIUM (A).

## BLOOD CELLS

### TYPES OF BLOOD CELLS
BLOOD CONTAINS RED, WHITE, AND PHAGOCYTES. RED BLOOD CELLS TRANSPORT OXYGEN, WHILE WHITE BLOOD CELLS AND PHAGOCYTES PLAY CRUCIAL ROLES IN IMMUNE RESPONSES.

WHITE BLOOD CELLS PRODUCE ANTIBODIES TO COMBAT BACTERIA, AND PHAGOCYTES ENGULF AND DIGEST PATHOGENS, CONTRIBUTING TO THE BODY'S DEFENSE MECHANISMS.

PLASMA PROTEINS ARE ALSO ESSENTIAL FOR BLOOD CLOTTING AND IMMUNE FUNCTION, HIGHLIGHTING THEIR DUAL ROLE IN MAINTAINING BODILY HEALTH.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: BLOOD AND CIRCULATION

## UNDERSTANDING HEART RATE CHANGES

### GRAPH ANALYSIS
THE GRAPH PRESENTS HEART RATE CHANGES OVER A 105-MINUTE PERIOD, SHOWING THE NUMBER OF BEATS PER MINUTE AT DIFFERENT TIME POINTS.

- **HEART RATE (BEATS PER MINUTE):** 110, 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50

### TIME INTERVALS
THE X-AXIS REPRESENTS TIME IN MINUTES, RANGING FROM 0 TO 105 MINUTES.

### QUESTIONS FOR ANALYSIS
USING THE GRAPH, IDENTIFY THE TIME PERIODS CORRESPONDING TO DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES:

1. RUNNING
2. FRIGHTENED BY A SUDDEN LOUD NOISE
3. SLEEPING
4. WAKING
5. AFTER A PERIOD OF EXERCISE

### HEART RATE DESCRIPTIONS
THE HEART RATE VARIES DEPENDING ON THE ACTIVITY OR STATE OF THE INDIVIDUAL:

- **AT REST:** THIS IS THE BASELINE HEART RATE WHEN NO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS ENGAGED.
- **BEFORE EXERCISE (PERIOD A):** THE HEART RATE JUST BEFORE INITIATING EXERCISE.
- **COMMENCING EXERCISE (PERIOD B):** THE HEART RATE INCREASES UPON STARTING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY.
- **RECOVERING FROM EXERCISE (PERIOD C):** THE HEART RATE DECREASES GRADUALLY DURING RECOVERY AFTER EXERCISE.

### ASSESSING FITNESS
THE RECOVERY PERIOD (PERIOD C) CAN BE USED TO ASSESS CARDIOVASCULAR FITNESS BY EVALUATING THE TIME IT TAKES FOR THE HEART RATE TO RETURN TO ITS RESTING VALUE. A QUICKER RETURN INDICATES BETTER CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH.

## CONCLUSION
UNDERSTANDING HEART RATE DYNAMICS IS ESSENTIAL FOR ANALYZING PHYSICAL FITNESS AND THE BODY'S RESPONSE TO VARIOUS ACTIVITIES. BY EXAMINING THE GRAPH AND ADDRESSING THE OUTLINED QUESTIONS, ONE CAN GAIN INSIGHTS INTO PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES RELATED TO BLOOD CIRCULATION AND HEART FUNCTION.
