# 5 BLOOD AND CIRCULATION

Large, multicellular animals need a circulatory system to transport substances to and from the cells of the body. This chapter looks at the structure and function of the circulatory systems of humans and other animals, the composition of mammalian blood, and disorders associated with the heart and circulation.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

- Understand why simple unicellular organisms can rely on diffusion for movement of substances in and out of the cell
- Understand the need for a transport system in multicellular organisms
- Understand the general structure of the circulation system, including the blood vessels to and from the heart and lungs, liver and kidneys
- Describe the structure of the heart and how it functions
- Understand how factors may increase the risk of developing coronary heart disease
- Explain how the heart rate changes during exercise and under the influence of adrenaline
- Understand how the structures of arteries, veins and capillaries relate to their functions
- Describe the composition of blood: red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and plasma
- Understand the role of plasma in the transport of carbon dioxide, digested food, urea, hormones and heat energy
- Understand how the adaptations of red blood cells make them suitable for the transport of oxygen, including shape, the absence of a nucleus and the presence of haemoglobin
- Understand how the immune system responds to infection using white blood cells, illustrated by phagocytes ingesting pathogens and lymphocytes releasing antibodies specific to the pathogen

## THE NEED FOR CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS

Figure 5.1 shows the circulatory system of a mammal.

Blood is pumped around a closed circuit made up of the heart and blood vessels. As it travels around the body, it collects materials from some places and unloads them in others. In mammals, blood transports:

- oxygen from the lungs to all other parts of the body
- carbon dioxide from all parts of the body to the lungs
- nutrients from the gut to all parts of the body
- urea from the liver to the kidneys.

Hormones, antibodies and many other substances are also transported by the blood. It also distributes heat around the body.

Single-celled organisms, like the ones shown in Figure 5.2, do not have circulatory systems.

▲ Figure 5.2 Unicellular organisms do not have circulatory systems.

There is no circulatory system to carry materials around the very small 'bodies' of these single-celled organisms. Materials can easily move around the cell without a special system. There is no need for lungs or gills to obtain oxygen from the environment either. Single-celled organisms obtain oxygen by diffusion through the surface membrane of the cell. The rest of the cell then uses the oxygen. The area of the cell's surface determines how much oxygen the organism can get (the supply rate), and the volume of the cell determines how much oxygen the organism uses (the demand rate).

The ratio of supply to demand can be written as: surface area

▲ Figure 5.1 The human circulatory system.

This is called the 'surface area to volume ratio' and it is affected by the size of an organism (see Chapter 1, Activity 4). Single-celled organisms have a high surface area to volume ratio. Their cell surface membrane has a large enough area to supply all the oxygen that their volume demands. In larger animals, the surface area to volume ratio is lower.

Large animals cannot get all the oxygen they need through their surface (even if the body surface would allow it to pass through) – there just isn't enough surface to supply all that volume. To overcome this problem, large organisms have evolved special gas exchange organs and circulatory systems. The gills of fish and the lungs of mammals are linked to a circulatory system that carries oxygen to all parts of the body. The same idea applies to obtaining nutrients – the gut obtains nutrients from food and the circulatory system distributes the nutrients around the body.

## THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS OF DIFFERENT ANIMALS

One of the main functions of a circulatory system in animals is to transport oxygen. Blood is pumped to a gas exchange organ to load oxygen. It is then pumped to other parts of the body where it unloads the oxygen. There are two main types of circulatory systems in animals.

■ In a single circulatory system the blood is pumped from the heart to the gas exchange organ and then directly to the rest of the body.

■ In a double circulatory system the blood is pumped from the heart to the gas exchange organ, back to the heart and then to the rest of the body.

Figure 5.3 shows the difference between these systems.

Figure 5.3 (a) The single circulatory system of a fish. The blood passes through the heart only once in a complete circuit of the body. (b) The double circulatory system of a human (and other mammals). The blood passes through the heart twice in one complete circuit of the body.

There are two parts to a double circulatory system:

- The pulmonary circulation. Deoxygenated blood leaves the heart through the pulmonary arteries, and is circulated through the lungs, where it becomes oxygenated. The oxygenated blood returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins.

- The systemic circulation. Oxygenated blood leaves the heart through the aorta and is circulated through all other parts of the body, where it unloads its oxygen. Deoxygenated blood returns to the heart through the vena cava.

A double circulatory system is more efficient than a single circulatory system. The heart pumps the blood twice, so higher pressures can be maintained. The blood travels more quickly to organs. In the single circulatory system of a fish, blood loses pressure as it passes through the gills. It then travels more slowly to the other organs.

The human circulatory system comprises:
- the heart - this is a pump
- blood vessels - these carry the blood around the body; arteries carry blood away from the heart and towards other organs, veins carry blood towards the heart and away from other organs and capillaries carry blood through organs, linking the arteries and veins
- blood - the transport medium.

Figure 5.4 shows the main blood vessels in the human circulatory system.

## CORONARY HEART DISEASE

The coronary arteries are among the narrowest in the body. They are easily blocked by a build-up of fatty substances (including cholesterol) in their walls. This can cut off the blood supply to an area of cardiac muscle. The affected muscle can no longer receive oxygen and glucose, so it cannot respire and release energy. This means it is unable to contract, resulting in a heart attack. This is called coronary heart disease (CHD). It can lead to severe health problems and is often fatal.

[A diagram of a heart showing coronary arteries, a blocked coronary artery, and a region deprived of oxygen]

Figure 5.7 A blockage of a coronary artery cuts off the blood supply to part of the heart muscle.

A number of factors make coronary heart disease more likely:

- heredity – some people inherit a tendency to develop coronary heart disease
- high blood pressure – puts more strain on the heart
- diet – eating large amounts of saturated fat is likely to raise cholesterol levels
- smoking – raises blood pressure and makes blood clots more likely to form
- stress – raises blood pressure
- lack of exercise – regular exercise helps to reduce blood pressure and strengthens the heart.

## HEART RATE

Normally the heart beats about 70 times a minute, but this can change according to the needs of the body. When we exercise, muscles must release more energy. They need an increased supply of oxygen for aerobic respiration (see Chapter 1). To deliver the extra oxygen, both the number of beats per minute (heart rate) and the volume of blood pumped with each beat (called stroke volume) increase.

When we are angry or afraid our heart rate again increases. The increased output supplies extra blood to the muscles, enabling them to release extra energy through aerobic respiration. This allows us to fight or run away and is called the 'fight or flight' response. It is triggered by secretion of the hormone adrenaline from the adrenal glands (see Chapter 7).

When we sleep, our heart rate decreases as all our organs are working more slowly. They need to release less energy and so need less oxygen.

These changes in the heart rate are controlled by nerve impulses from a part of the brain called the medulla (Figure 5.8). When we start to

Have you noticed a 'hollow' or 'fluttering' feeling in your stomach when you are anxious? It happens because blood that would normally flow to your stomach and intestines has been diverted to the muscles to allow the 'fight or flight' response.

                                              Arteries carry blood from the heart to the organs of the body: This arterial
                                              blood is pumped out by the ventricles at a high pressure_ Elastic tissue in the

                                              Veins carry blood from organs back towards the heart: The pressure of this
                                              venous blood is much lower than that in the arteries. It puts very little pressure
                                              on the walls of the veins, so they can be thinner than those of arteries, and
                                              contain less elastic tissue and muscle.Figure 5.9 shows the structure of a

## EXTENSION WORK

Arterioles are small arteries. They carry blood into organs from arteries. Their structure is similar to the larger arteries, but they have a larger proportion of muscle fibres in their walls. They are also supplied with nerve endings in their walls and so can be made to dilate (become wider) or constrict (become narrower) to allow more or less blood into the organ.

If all the arterioles constrict, it is harder for blood to pass through them - there is more resistance. This increases blood pressure. Prolonged stress can cause arterioles to constrict and so increase blood pressure.

Veins also have semilunar (half-moon shaped) valves, which prevent the backflow of blood. The action of these valves is explained in Figure 5.10.

## KEY POINT

All arteries carry oxygenated blood (blood containing a lot of oxygen) except the pulmonary artery and the umbilical artery of an unborn baby. All veins carry deoxygenated blood (blood containing less oxygen) except the pulmonary vein and umbilical vein.

Capillaries carry blood through organs, bringing the blood close to every cell in the organ. Substances are transferred between the blood in the capillary and the cells. To do this, capillaries must be small enough to 'fit' between cells, and allow materials to pass through their walls easily. Figure 5.11 shows the structure of a capillary and how exchange of substances takes place between the capillary and nearby cells. The walls of capillaries are one cell thick, providing a short distance for diffusion of materials into and out of the blood. Red blood cells just fit through the tiny diameter of capillaries, so they are close to the capillary wall. This means that there is a short distance for oxygen to diffuse. Figure 5.12 shows a photograph of a cross-section through an artery and a vein.

## THE COMPOSITION OF BLOOD

Blood is a lot more than just a red liquid flowing through your arteries and veins! In fact, blood is a complex tissue. Figure 5.13 illustrates the main types of cells found in blood.

Figure 5.13 The different types of blood cells. (a) Diagram of the different cells. (b) A blood smear seen through a light microscope. The smear shows many red blood cells and three different kinds of white blood cell.

The different parts of blood have different functions. These are described in Table 5.1.

| COMPONENT OF BLOOD | DESCRIPTION OF COMPONENT | FUNCTION OF COMPONENT |
|---------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| plasma | liquid part of blood: mainly water | carries the blood cells around the body; carries dissolved nutrients, hormones, carbon dioxide and urea; also distributes heat around the body |
| red blood cells (erythrocytes) | biconcave, disc-like cells with no nucleus; millions in each mm³ of blood | transport of oxygen – contain mainly haemoglobin, which loads oxygen in the lungs and unloads it in other regions of the body |

## RED BLOOD CELLS

The red blood cells or erythrocytes are highly specialised cells made in the bone marrow. They have a limited life span of about 100 days after which time they are destroyed in the spleen. They have only one function – to transport oxygen. Several features enable them to carry out this function very efficiently.

Red blood cells contain haemoglobin. This is an iron-containing protein that associates (combines) with oxygen to form oxyhaemoglobin when there is a high concentration of oxygen in the surroundings. We say that the red blood cell is loading oxygen. When the concentration of oxygen is low, oxyhaemoglobin turns back into haemoglobin and the red blood cell unloads its oxygen.

As red blood cells pass through the lungs, they load oxygen. As they pass through active tissues they unload oxygen.

| haemoglobin + oxygen | in the lungs → | oxyhaemoglobin |
|----------------------|----------------|-----------------|
|                      | in the tissues ← |                 |

Red blood cells do not contain a nucleus. It is lost during their development in the bone marrow. This means that more haemoglobin can be packed into each red blood cell so more oxygen can be transported. Their biconcave shape allows efficient exchange of oxygen in and out of the cell. Each red blood cell has a high surface area to volume ratio, giving a large area for diffusion. The thin shape of the cell results in a short diffusion distance to the centre of the cell.

## WHITE BLOOD CELLS

There are several types of white blood cell. Their main role is to protect the body against invasion by disease-causing microorganisms (pathogens), such as bacteria and viruses. They do this in two main ways: phagocytosis and production of antibodies.

About 70% of white blood cells can ingest (take in) microorganisms such as bacteria. This is called phagocytosis, and the cells are phagocytes. They do this by changing their shape, producing extensions of their cytoplasm, called pseudopodia. The pseudopodia surround and enclose the microorganism in a vacuole. Once it is inside, the phagocyte secretes enzymes into the vacuole to break the microorganism down (Figure 5.14). Phagocytosis means 'cell eating' – you can see why it is called this.

Approximately 25% of white blood cells are lymphocytes. Their function is to make chemicals called antibodies. Antibodies are soluble proteins that pass into the plasma. Pathogens such as bacteria and viruses have chemical 'markers' on their surfaces, which the antibodies recognise. These markers are called antigens. The antibodies stick to the surface antigens and destroy the pathogen. They do this in a number of ways, for example by:

- causing bacteria to stick together, so that phagocytes can ingest them more easily
- acting as a 'label' on the pathogen, so that it is more easily recognised by a phagocyte
- causing bacterial cells to burst open
- neutralising poisons (toxins) produced by pathogens.

The production of antibodies following the first exposure to a foreign antigen is called the primary immune response.
