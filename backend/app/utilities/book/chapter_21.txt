# GENETIC MODIFICATION

In this chapter we look at microorganisms that are grown in order to make products that are of use to humans.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

- Understand that the term 'transgenic' means the transfer of genetic material from one species to a different species
- Understand how restriction enzymes are used to cut DNA at specific sites and ligase enzymes are used to join pieces of DNA together
- Understand how plasmids and viruses can act as vectors, which take up pieces of DNA, and then insert this recombinant DNA into other cells
- Understand how large amounts of human insulin can be manufactured from genetically modified bacteria that are grown in a fermenter
- Understand how genetically modified plants can be used to improve food production

In Chapter 16 you saw that a gene is a section of a molecule of DNA that codes
for the production of a protein. One strand of the DNA (called the coding strand) contains triplets of bases, each triplet coding for one amino acid. Different genes produce different proteins because each has a unique sequence of bases that codes for a unique sequence of amino acids (Figure 21.1).

The protein that is produced could be:

- an enzyme that controls a particular reaction inside a cell or in the digestive system
- a structural protein like keratin in hair, collagen in skin or one of the many proteins found in the membranes of cells
- a protein hormone such as insulin
- a protein with a specific function such as haemoglobin or an antibody.

### RECOMBINANT DNA
The production of recombinant DNA is the basis of genetic engineering. A section of DNA – a gene – is cut out of the DNA of one species and inserted into the DNA of another. This new DNA is called 'recombinant' DNA because the DNA from two different organisms has been 'recombined'. The organism that receives the gene from a different species is a transgenic organism.

       DID YOU KNOW?                         1. Human insulin People suffering from diabetes need a reliable source of
       More insulin is required every           insulin. Before the use of genetic engineering to make human insulin, the
                                                only insulin available was extracted from the pancreases of other animals

                                                can digest these large, insoluble molecules into smaller; soluble ones_

                                                digest proteins and lipases digest lipids. Bacteria have been genetically
                                                engineered to produce enzymes that work at higher temperatures, allowing
                                                even faster and more effective action.

3. Enzymes in the food industry
One bacterial enzyme used in the food industry is glucose isomerase. This enzyme catalyses a reaction which converts glucose into a similar sugar called fructose. Fructose is much sweeter than glucose and so less is needed to sweeten foods. This has two advantages – it saves money (since less is used) and it means that the food contains less sugar and is healthier.

4. Human growth hormone
The pituitary gland of some children does not produce enough of this hormone and they show a slow rate of growth. Injections of growth hormone from genetically modified bacteria restore normal growth patterns.

5. Bovine somatotrophin (BST) (a growth hormone in cattle)
This hormone increases the milk yield of cows and increases the muscle (meat) production of bulls. Giving injections of BST to dairy cattle can increase the milk yield by up to 10kg per day. To do this they need more food, but this increased cost is more than offset by the increased income from the increased milk yield (Table 21.1).

6. Human vaccines
Bacteria have been genetically modified to produce the antigens of the hepatitis B virus. This is used in the vaccine against hepatitis B. The body makes antibodies against the antigens but there is no risk of contracting the actual disease from the vaccination.

Table 21.1 Effects of BST on milk yield.

| | Feed / kg per day | Milk output / kg per day | Milk to feed ratio |
|------------|------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| without BST | 34.1 | 27.9 | 0.82 |
| with BST | 37.8 | 37.3 | 0.99 |

Since the basic techniques of transferring genes were developed, many unicellular organisms have been genetically modified to produce useful products. Techniques for transferring genes into plants and animals have also been developed.

## PRODUCING GENETICALLY MODIFIED PLANTS

The gene technology described so far can transfer DNA from one cell to another cell. In the case of bacteria, this is fine – a bacterium only has one cell. But plants have billions of cells and to genetically modify a plant, each cell must receive the new gene. So, any procedure for genetically modifying plants has two main stages:

- introducing the new gene or genes into plant cells
- producing whole plants from just a few cells.

Biologists initially had problems in inserting genes into plant cells. They then discovered a soil bacterium called Agrobacterium, which regularly inserts plasmids into plant cells. Now that a vector had been found, the rest became possible. Figure 21.6 outlines one procedure that uses Agrobacterium as a vector.

                                               These are then 'fired' directly into plant tissue. Research has shown
                                               that if young; delicate tissue is used, there is a good uptake of the DNA
                                               The genetically modified tissue can then be grown into new plants using the
                                               same micropropagation techniques as those used in the Agrobacterium

# LOOKING AHEAD - THE POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a laboratory process that amplifies DNA. This means that it rapidly produces a large number of copies of a piece of DNA, starting from as little as one molecule. The invention of PCR revolutionised gene technology and is used in virtually every application of the science.

Each cycle of PCR doubles the amount of DNA, producing an exponential increase in the numbers of copies (Figure 21.10). Thirty cycles produces over a billion copies of the original DNA.

| PCR Cycle | Number of DNA Copies |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Start     | 1 Copy               |
| 1st cycle | 2 Copies             |
| 2nd cycle | 4 Copies             |
| 3rd cycle | 8 Copies             |
| 4th cycle | 16 Copies            |

Figure 21.10 PCR produces an exponential increase in the number of copies of a piece of DNA.

The procedure uses short lengths of single-stranded DNA called primers, which are precisely complementary to one end of each strand of the DNA you wish to amplify. The DNA is heated to separate the strands and the primers added to the ends of each strand. An enzyme called DNA polymerase builds up two new complimentary strands by adding nucleotides - one at a time - along each strand.

Nowadays, PCR is an automated process and can be performed in as little as 2-3 hours in a PCR machine. You just place small tubes containing the DNA sample, primers, free nucleotides, DNA polymerase and a buffer solution in the machine, switch on, and wait for the results.
