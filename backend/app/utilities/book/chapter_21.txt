# MICROORGANISMS AND GENETIC MODIFICATION

## GENETIC MODIFICATION

THE PROCESS OF GENETIC MODIFICATION ALLOWS SCIENTISTS TO MANIPULATE GENES AND PRODUCE GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS (GMOS) THROUGH GENETIC ENGINEERING. THIS CHAPTER EXPLORES THE TECHNIQUES USED IN THIS FIELD.

### LEARNING OBJECTIVES

1. **UNDERSTANDING TRANSGENIC ORGANISMS**: A TRANSGENIC ORGANISM CONTAINS GENETIC MATERIAL FROM ANOTHER SPECIES. FOR EXAMPLE, BACTERIA CAN BE ENGINEERED TO PRODUCE HUMAN INSULIN.
2. **INSULIN PRODUCTION**: GENETICALLY MODIFIED BACTERIA ARE CULTIVATED IN FERMENTERS TO MASS-PRODUCE HUMAN INSULIN.
3. **RESTRICTION ENZYMES AND LIGASE**: THESE ENZYMES ARE CRUCIAL FOR CUTTING DNA AT SPECIFIC SITES AND JOINING DNA FRAGMENTS, RESPECTIVELY.
4. **VECTORS IN GENETIC ENGINEERING**: PLASMIDS AND VIRUSES ACT AS VECTORS, INTRODUCING RECOMBINANT DNA INTO HOST ORGANISMS.
5. **GM PLANTS IN AGRICULTURE**: GENETICALLY MODIFIED PLANTS IMPROVE FOOD PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY.

### DNA'S ROLE IN PROTEIN SYNTHESIS

GENES ARE SEGMENTS OF DNA THAT CODE FOR PROTEINS. THE CODING STRAND CONTAINS TRIPLETS OF BASES THAT TRANSLATE INTO AMINO ACIDS. EACH GENE PRODUCES A UNIQUE PROTEIN DUE TO ITS SPECIFIC BASE SEQUENCE, LEADING TO DIVERSE FUNCTIONS SUCH AS ENZYMES, STRUCTURAL PROTEINS, HORMONES, OR ANTIBODIES.

**FIGURE 21.1** ILLUSTRATES HOW THE GENETIC CODE ON ONE DNA STRAND DETERMINES THE AMINO ACID SEQUENCE IN A PROTEIN. THIS PROCESS IS CENTRAL TO LIFE, ENABLING THE CREATION OF COMPLEX MOLECULES ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS BIOLOGICAL ROLES.

### RECOMBINANT DNA

RECOMBINANT DNA IS THE FOUNDATION OF GENETIC ENGINEERING. A SEGMENT FROM ONE SPECIES' DNA IS INSERTED INTO ANOTHER, CREATING TRANSGENIC ORGANISMS. THIS TECHNIQUE ALLOWS FOR TAILORED MODIFICATIONS ACROSS DIFFERENT FIELDS, INCLUDING MEDICINE AND AGRICULTURE.

### TRANSGENIC ORGANISMS

TRANSGENIC ORGANISMS POSSESS GENES FROM OTHER SPECIES. FOR INSTANCE, BACTERIA PRODUCE HUMAN INSULIN, WHILE SHEEP SECRETE ALPHA-1-ANTITRYPSIN IN THEIR MILK DUE TO HUMAN GENE TRANSFER. THESE ORGANISMS ARE CLASSIFIED AS TRANSGENIC BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN FOREIGN GENETIC MATERIAL.

### VECTORS IN GENETIC ENGINEERING

VECTORS LIKE PLASMIDS AND VIRUSES FACILITATE THE TRANSFER OF RECOMBINANT DNA INTO HOST CELLS. PLASMIDS, CIRCULAR DNA MOLECULES, CAN BE ENGINEERED WITH SPECIFIC GENES FOR EXPRESSION IN HOST ORGANISMS. VIRUSES, SUCH AS BACTERIOPHAGE, DELIVER GENETIC MATERIAL EFFICIENTLY DURING INFECTION.

### APPLICATIONS IN FOOD PRODUCTION

GENETICALLY MODIFIED PLANTS ARE UTILIZED TO ENHANCE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY. FOR EXAMPLE, CROPS MAY EXHIBIT TRAITS LIKE DROUGHT RESISTANCE OR INCREASED YIELD, CONTRIBUTING TO FOOD SECURITY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH.

THIS STRUCTURED APPROACH ENSURES CLARITY AND FACTUAL ACCURACY, MAINTAINING AN EDUCATIONAL TONE WITHOUT READER-DIRECTED LANGUAGE. EACH SECTION IS PRESENTED AS A COHERENT PARAGRAPH, REFLECTING THE HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE OF GENETIC ENGINEERING CONCEPTS.

# MICROORGANISMS AND GENETIC MODIFICATION

## GENETIC MODIFICATION

GENETIC MODIFICATION INVOLVES ALTERING THE GENETIC MATERIAL OF AN ORGANISM TO GIVE IT NEW CAPABILITIES. FOR INSTANCE, WHEN A BACTERIUM RECEIVES A HUMAN GENE THAT CODES FOR INSULIN PRODUCTION, IT CAN MANUFACTURE HUMAN INSULIN. WHEN THESE TRANSGENIC BACTERIA ARE CULTURED IN LARGE QUANTITIES, THEY EFFECTIVELY BECOME FACTORIES FOR PRODUCING INSULIN.

### PRODUCING GENETICALLY MODIFIED (TRANSGENIC) BACTERIA

THE ABILITY TO TRANSFER DNA FROM ONE CELL TO ANOTHER WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCED BY THE DISCOVERY THAT BACTERIA POSSESS TWO TYPES OF DNA: THE DNA FOUND IN THEIR BACTERIAL CHROMOSOME AND SMALLER CIRCULAR PIECES OF DNA KNOWN AS PLASMIDS. BACTERIA NATURALLY EXCHANGE PLASMIDS, AND SCIENTISTS HAVE DEVELOPED METHODS TO FACILITATE THE TRANSFER OF PLASMIDS BETWEEN BACTERIA.

THE NEXT STEP IN THIS PROCESS WAS TO IDENTIFY MOLECULAR TOOLS THAT COULD CUT AND PASTE DNA SEGMENTS.

#### KEY ENZYMES IN GENETIC MODIFICATION

1. **RESTRICTION ENDONUCLEASES (RESTRICTION ENZYMES)**: THESE ENZYMES CUT DNA MOLECULES AT SPECIFIC SEQUENCES. EACH RESTRICTION ENZYME RECOGNIZES A PARTICULAR BASE SEQUENCE IN A DNA STRAND AND WILL CUT THE DNA WHEREVER IT ENCOUNTERS THAT SEQUENCE. FOR EXAMPLE, IF A RESTRICTION ENZYME RECOGNIZES THE SEQUENCE G-A-A-T-T-C, IT WILL ONLY CUT AT THAT SPECIFIC LOCATION.

2. **LIGASES (DNA LIGASES)**: THESE ENZYMES JOIN THE CUT ENDS OF DNA TOGETHER. THEY CAN EFFECTIVELY CONNECT DNA FRAGMENTS IF THEY HAVE COMPATIBLE ENDS.

### TYPES OF DNA CUTS

- **BLUNT ENDS**: SOME RESTRICTION ENZYMES MAKE A STRAIGHT CUT, RESULTING IN DNA FRAGMENTS WITH BLUNT ENDS.
  
- **STICKY ENDS**: OTHER RESTRICTION ENZYMES MAKE STAGGERED CUTS, PRODUCING FRAGMENTS WITH OVERLAPPING ENDS THAT HAVE COMPLEMENTARY BASES. THESE OVERLAPPING ENDS ARE REFERRED TO AS "STICKY ENDS" BECAUSE THEY CAN EASILY BE JOINED BY LIGASE ENZYMES.

BY UNDERSTANDING THESE PROCESSES AND TOOLS, SCIENTISTS CAN EFFECTIVELY MODIFY MICROORGANISMS FOR VARIOUS APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING THE PRODUCTION OF IMPORTANT PROTEINS LIKE INSULIN.

# MICROORGANISMS AND GENETIC MODIFICATION

## GENETIC MODIFICATION

BIOLOGISTS HAVE DEVELOPED METHODS TO TRANSFER GENES FROM ONE CELL TO ANOTHER, PARTICULARLY INTO BACTERIA. THIS PROCESS INVOLVES CREATING RECOMBINANT DNA AND TRANSGENIC BACTERIA, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING THE PRODUCTION OF HUMAN INSULIN.

### KEY CONCEPTS

- **PLASMIDS**: THESE ARE SMALL, CIRCULAR DNA MOLECULES FOUND IN BACTERIA. THEY CAN REPLICATE INDEPENDENTLY OF THE BACTERIAL CHROMOSOME AND ARE OFTEN USED AS VECTORS IN GENETIC ENGINEERING.

- **VECTORS**: A VECTOR IS A MEANS OF TRANSFERRING GENETIC MATERIAL INTO A HOST CELL. IN THIS CONTEXT, PLASMIDS SERVE AS VECTORS FOR GENE TRANSFER.

### STEPS IN PRODUCING A TRANSGENIC BACTERIUM

1. **ISOLATION OF PLASMIDS**: PLASMIDS ARE EXTRACTED FROM A BACTERIUM.

2. **CUTTING THE GENE**: THE GENE INTENDED FOR TRANSFER IS CUT FROM THE DONOR DNA USING A SPECIFIC RESTRICTION ENZYME. THIS ENZYME CREATES "STICKY ENDS" ON BOTH THE PLASMID AND THE DONOR DNA.

3. **CREATING RECOMBINANT PLASMIDS**: THE OPENED PLASMIDS AND THE ISOLATED GENE ARE MIXED WITH DNA LIGASE ENZYME, WHICH FACILITATES THE JOINING OF THE DNA FRAGMENTS TO FORM RECOMBINANT PLASMIDS.

4. **TRANSFORMATION**: BACTERIA ARE INCUBATED WITH THE RECOMBINANT PLASMIDS. SOME BACTERIA WILL TAKE UP THESE PLASMIDS, INCORPORATING THE NEW GENE INTO THEIR OWN DNA.

5. **EXPRESSION OF THE GENE**: THE BACTERIA THAT SUCCESSFULLY TAKE UP THE PLASMID NOW CONTAIN THE GENE FROM THE DONOR CELL. THIS COULD BE A GENE THAT CONTROLS THE PRODUCTION OF HUMAN INSULIN.

### ALTERNATIVE VECTORS

ANOTHER METHOD OF INTRODUCING FOREIGN DNA INTO BACTERIAL CELLS INVOLVES THE USE OF **BACTERIOPHAGES** (OR "PHAGES"). A BACTERIOPHAGE IS A VIRUS THAT SPECIFICALLY ATTACKS BACTERIA. IT ATTACHES TO THE BACTERIAL CELL WALL AND INJECTS ITS OWN DNA INTO THE BACTERIAL CELL. THIS VIRAL DNA CAN THEN BECOME INTEGRATED INTO THE HOST'S DNA, LEADING TO THE PRODUCTION OF NEW VIRUS PARTICLES.

### VISUAL REPRESENTATION

REFER TO **FIGURE 21.4** FOR A VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE STAGES INVOLVED IN PRODUCING A TRANSGENIC BACTERIUM, AND **FIGURE 21.5** FOR AN ILLUSTRATION OF HOW A BACTERIOPHAGE OPERATES.

# MICROORGANISMS AND GENETIC MODIFICATION

## MAKING USE OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED BACTERIA

GENETIC MODIFICATION INVOLVES INTRODUCING FOREIGN GENES INTO BACTERIAL DNA, OFTEN FACILITATED BY VECTORS LIKE VIRUSES OR PLASMIDS. EARLY METHODS RELIED ON VIRUSES FOR GENE TRANSFER, BUT MODERN TECHNIQUES PRIMARILY USE PLASMIDS.

**FIGURE 21.5**: A BACTERIOPHAGE INFECTS A BACTERIAL CELL, INJECTING ITS DNA TO INTEGRATE FOREIGN GENES INTO THE HOST'S GENOME.

### APPLICATIONS OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED BACTERIA

GENETICALLY MODIFIED BACTERIA ARE CULTURED IN FERMENTERS TO PRODUCE LARGE QUANTITIES OF DESIRED PRODUCTS. TWO NOTABLE APPLICATIONS INCLUDE:

1. **HUMAN INSULIN PRODUCTION**:
   - INSULIN IS ESSENTIAL FOR MANAGING DIABETES. PREVIOUSLY SOURCED FROM ANIMALS, IT DIFFERED FROM HUMAN INSULIN, OFFERING LESS EFFECTIVE CONTROL. GENETIC ENGINEERING ENABLES THE PRODUCTION OF HUMAN INSULIN, PROVIDING A MORE RELIABLE AND EFFECTIVE SOLUTION.

2. **ENZYME PRODUCTION FOR CLEANING AGENTS**:
   - ENZYMES EFFECTIVELY BREAK DOWN BIOLOGICAL STAINS. GENETICALLY MODIFIED BACTERIA PRODUCE ENZYMES LIKE AMYLASES, PROTEASES, AND LIPASES THAT FUNCTION AT HIGH TEMPERATURES, ENHANCING STAIN REMOVAL EFFICIENCY IN LAUNDRY DETERGENTS.

THESE INNOVATIONS HIGHLIGHT THE VALUE OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED BACTERIA IN PRODUCING ESSENTIAL PRODUCTS, FROM INSULIN TO CLEANING AGENTS, DEMONSTRATING THEIR SIGNIFICANCE IN MODERN BIOTECHNOLOGY.

# MICROORGANISMS AND GENETIC MODIFICATION

## GENETIC MODIFICATION

### ENZYMES IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY
ONE BACTERIAL ENZYME USED IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY IS GLUCOSE ISOMERASE. THIS ENZYME CATALYZES A REACTION THAT CONVERTS GLUCOSE INTO FRUCTOSE, A SUGAR THAT IS SWEETER THAN GLUCOSE. AS A RESULT, LESS FRUCTOSE IS NEEDED TO SWEETEN FOODS, OFFERING TWO SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES: IT SAVES MONEY AND RESULTS IN HEALTHIER FOODS WITH LOWER SUGAR CONTENT.

### HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE
THE PITUITARY GLAND OF SOME CHILDREN DOES NOT PRODUCE ENOUGH GROWTH HORMONE, LEADING TO SLOW GROWTH. BEFORE THE AVAILABILITY OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED BACTERIA, GROWTH HORMONE WAS SOURCED FROM HUMAN CORPSES, A PRACTICE THAT CARRIED HEALTH RISKS. CHILDREN TREATED WITH THIS METHOD SOMETIMES DEVELOPED CREUTZFELDT-JAKOB DISEASE.

### BOVINE SOMATOTROPIN (BST)
BOVINE SOMATOTROPIN (BST) IS A GROWTH HORMONE IN CATTLE THAT INCREASES MILK YIELD AND MUSCLE PRODUCTION IN BULLS. INJECTIONS OF BST CAN BOOST DAIRY COW MILK YIELD BY UP TO 10 KG PER DAY, DESPITE INCREASED FEED REQUIREMENTS, THE HIGHER INCOME FROM INCREASED MILK OUTPUT OFFSETS THESE COSTS.

### HUMAN VACCINES
BACTERIA HAVE BEEN GENETICALLY MODIFIED TO PRODUCE ANTIGENS FROM THE HEPATITIS B VIRUS FOR VACCINES. THESE ANTIGENS STIMULATE ANTIBODY PRODUCTION WITHOUT POSING A DISEASE RISK.

### PRODUCING GENETICALLY MODIFIED PLANTS
GENETIC MODIFICATION IN PLANTS INVOLVES TWO MAIN STAGES: INTRODUCING NEW GENES INTO PLANT CELLS AND PRODUCING WHOLE PLANTS FROM THESE CELLS. THE PROCESS WAS FACILITATED BY THE DISCOVERY OF AGROBACTERIUM, A SOIL BACTERIUM THAT NATURALLY INSERTS PLASMIDS INTO PLANT CELLS, SERVING AS AN EFFECTIVE VECTOR FOR GENE TRANSFER.

## CONCLUSION
SINCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF GENE TRANSFER TECHNIQUES, MANY UNICELLULAR ORGANISMS HAVE BEEN MODIFIED TO PRODUCE USEFUL PRODUCTS. ADVANCES IN TRANSFERRING GENES INTO PLANTS AND ANIMALS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTED TO BIOTECHNOLOGY AND AGRICULTURE.

# MICROORGANISMS AND GENETIC MODIFICATION

## GENETIC MODIFICATION PROCESS

GENETIC MODIFICATION INVOLVES ALTERING AN ORGANISM'S DNA BY INTRODUCING DNA FROM ANOTHER SPECIES. THIS PROCESS TYPICALLY INCLUDES SEVERAL KEY STEPS:

1. **ISOLATING THE DESIRED GENE**: 
   - DNA IS CUT USING RESTRICTION ENZYMES TO ISOLATE THE DESIRED GENE.
   - A PLASMID, A SMALL CIRCULAR DNA MOLECULE, IS ALSO CUT OPEN WITH THE SAME RESTRICTION ENZYME.

2. **JOINING THE GENE TO THE PLASMID**:
   - THE DESIRED GENE IS THEN JOINED TO THE PLASMID USING LIGASE, AN ENZYME THAT FACILITATES THE JOINING OF DNA STRANDS.

3. **TRANSFORMATION OF PLANT CELLS**:
   - LEAF DISCS ARE OBTAINED FROM THE PLANT TO BE MODIFIED.
   - THESE LEAF DISCS ARE FLOATED ON A LIQUID CONTAINING THE PLASMIDS; SOME CELLS TAKE UP THE PLASMID.

4. **CULTIVATION**:
   - THE LEAF DISCS ARE CULTIVATED ON A NUTRIENT MEDIUM THROUGH MICROPROPAGATION, LEADING TO THE GROWTH OF PLANTLETS THAT CAN DEVELOP INTO WHOLE PLANTS EXPRESSING THE FOREIGN GENE.

## LIMITATIONS OF AGROBACTERIUM

THE TECHNIQUE USING *AGROBACTERIUM TUMEFACIENS* IS NOT APPLICABLE TO ALL PLANTS, PARTICULARLY CEREALS. FOR THESE PLANTS, AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD CALLED THE GENE GUN WAS DEVELOPED.

## THE GENE GUN TECHNIQUE

THE GENE GUN IS A DEVICE THAT "FIRES" TINY PELLETS OF GOLD COATED WITH DNA CONTAINING THE DESIRED GENE DIRECTLY INTO PLANT TISSUE:

- **PROCESS**:
  - YOUNG, DELICATE TISSUE IS USED TO ENSURE GOOD DNA UPTAKE.
  - MICROPROPAGATION TECHNIQUES USED WITH *AGROBACTERIUM* CAN THEN BE APPLIED TO THE GENETICALLY MODIFIED TISSUE.

## APPLICATIONS OF GENETIC MODIFICATION

THE GENE GUN HAS ENABLED GENETIC MODIFICATION OF VARIOUS PLANTS, INCLUDING:

- CEREAL CROPS
- TOBACCO
- CARROTS
- SOYBEANS
- APPLES
- OILSEED RAPE
- COTTON

THESE MODIFICATIONS HAVE LED TO BENEFITS SUCH AS EXTENDED SHELF LIFE IN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND IMPROVED RESISTANCE TO PESTS AND DISEASES.

## CURRENT STATUS OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED PLANTS

LARGE NUMBERS OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED PLANTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR GROWERS. THESE PLANTS OFFER ADVANTAGES LIKE LONGER SHELF LIFE AND ENHANCED PEST RESISTANCE, MAKING THEM VALUABLE IN AGRICULTURE.

## ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

THE DEBATE OVER GENETICALLY MODIFIED (GM) CROPS CONTINUES, WITH ONGOING RESEARCH NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND VARIOUS PERSPECTIVES ON THEIR RIGHTS AND WRONGS.

# MICROORGANISMS AND GENETIC MODIFICATION

## GENETIC MODIFICATION

GENETIC MODIFICATION INVOLVES ALTERING THE DNA OF ORGANISMS TO ACHIEVE DESIRED TRAITS. THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN APPLIED TO BOTH PLANTS AND ANIMALS, LEADING TO VARIOUS ADVANCEMENTS IN AGRICULTURE AND MEDICINE.

### GENETICALLY MODIFIED PLANTS

ONE SIGNIFICANT APPLICATION OF GENETIC MODIFICATION IN PLANTS IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF CROPS THAT ARE RESISTANT TO HERBICIDES. THIS ALLOWS FARMERS TO APPLY HERBICIDES MORE EFFECTIVELY WITHOUT HARMING THE CROP. HOWEVER, THERE ARE CONCERNS THAT THIS MAY LEAD TO LESS CAREFUL USE OF HERBICIDES.

ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE TRANSFER OF GENES FROM ARCTIC FISH TO CERTAIN PLANTS, ENABLING THEM TO WITHSTAND FROST.

#### GOLDEN RICE

A NOTABLE ACHIEVEMENT IN GENETIC MODIFICATION IS THE CREATION OF 'GOLDEN RICE' (FIGURE 21.8). THIS RICE HAS BEEN ENGINEERED TO CONTAIN THREE ADDITIONAL GENES—TWO FROM DAFFODILS AND ONE FROM A BACTERIUM. THESE GENES ENABLE THE RICE TO PRODUCE BETA-CAROTENE, THE PIGMENT THAT GIVES CARROTS THEIR COLOR. THE RICE'S YELLOW HUE IS WHY IT IS CALLED 'GOLDEN RICE.' BETA-CAROTENE IS CONVERTED INTO VITAMIN A WHEN CONSUMED, WHICH COULD HELP PREVENT BLINDNESS IN MILLIONS OF CHILDREN IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WHO LACK SUFFICIENT VITAMIN A IN THEIR DIETS.

!FIGURE 21.8 GOLDEN RICE

### EXTENSION WORK

WHILE GOLDEN RICE PRESENTS A PROMISING SOLUTION, IT HAS FACED SEVERAL CHALLENGES. SOME INDIVIDUALS RAISE ETHICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS REGARDING ITS CULTIVATION. CRITICS ARGUE THAT IT MAY BE BETTER TO PROMOTE NATURAL CROPS THAT ALREADY CONTAIN ADEQUATE BETA-CAROTENE.

#### ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF GOLDEN RICE

YOU COULD CONDUCT RESEARCH INTO THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF GOLDEN RICE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND ITS IMPLICATIONS.

### KEY POINT

IMAGINE IF YOU COULD RECEIVE A 'VACCINATION' EVERY TIME YOU ATE A BANANA! SCIENTISTS ARE EXPLORING THE POSSIBILITY OF TRANSFERRING GENES THAT PRODUCE ANTIGENS FOR CERTAIN DISEASES INTO BANANAS. IF SUCCESSFUL, CONSUMING THESE BANANAS COULD STIMULATE AN IMMUNE RESPONSE WITHOUT THE NEED FOR NEEDLES.

### FUTURE PROSPECTS

RESEARCH INTO GENETICALLY MODIFIED PLANTS AIMS TO PROVIDE CROPS WITH:

- INCREASED RESISTANCE TO PESTS AND PATHOGENS
- ENHANCED HEAT AND DROUGHT TOLERANCE
- IMPROVED SALT TOLERANCE
- A BETTER BALANCE OF PROTEINS, CARBOHYDRATES, LIPIDS, VITAMINS, AND MINERALS

ADDITIONALLY, SOME GENETICALLY MODIFIED OILSEED RAPE PLANTS ARE BEING DEVELOPED FOR LARGE-SCALE PRODUCTION OF BIODEGRADABLE PLASTICS AND ANTI-COAGULANTS.

ONE OF THE MOST AMBITIOUS GOALS IS TO MODIFY CROP PLANTS, SUCH AS CEREALS AND POTATOES, TO FORM NODULES OF NITROGEN-FIXING BACTERIA ON THEIR ROOTS. CURRENTLY, ONLY LEGUMES (LIKE PEAS AND BEANS) CAN DO THIS. IF SCIENTISTS CAN TRANSFER THESE GENES TO OTHER PLANTS, IT COULD ALLOW CROPS TO THRIVE IN INFERTILE SOILS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR CHEMICAL FERTILIZERS. THE BACTERIA WOULD CONVERT ATMOSPHERIC NITROGEN INTO A USABLE FORM FOR THE PLANTS, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING PRODUCTION COSTS.

### PRODUCING GENETICALLY MODIFIED ANIMALS

CREATING GENETICALLY MODIFIED ANIMALS PRESENTS CHALLENGES SIMILAR TO THOSE ENCOUNTERED WITH PLANTS. ANIMALS ARE MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS, SO IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SIMPLY TRANSFER A GENE TO A SINGLE CELL; THAT CELL MUST DEVELOP INTO A COMPLETE ORGANISM. THE PLASMID TECHNOLOGY USED IN PLANT MODIFICATION IS ALSO APPLICABLE TO ANIMALS, BUT THE PROCESS IS MORE COMPLEX.

IN SUMMARY, GENETIC MODIFICATION HOLDS GREAT POTENTIAL FOR IMPROVING FOOD SECURITY AND HEALTH OUTCOMES, BUT IT ALSO RAISES IMPORTANT ETHICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUESTIONS THAT MUST BE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED.

# MICROORGANISMS AND GENETIC MODIFICATION

## DID YOU KNOW?
XENOTRANSPLANTATION INVOLVES THE TRANSFER OF ANIMAL ORGANS TO HUMANS. THIS PROCESS HAS POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS IN ADDRESSING ORGAN SHORTAGES.

### TRANSGENIC PIGS
TRANSGENIC PIGS HAVE BEEN ENGINEERED WITH GENES THAT PRODUCE HUMAN MARKER ANTIGENS ON THEIR CELL SURFACES. THIS MODIFICATION COULD REDUCE ORGAN REJECTION IN HUMAN RECIPIENTS, POTENTIALLY ALLEVIATING THE SHORTAGE OF DONOR ORGANS.

### ETHICAL CONCERNS
THE USE OF ANIMAL ORGANS FOR HUMAN TRANSPLANTATION RAISES SIGNIFICANT ETHICAL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE TREATMENT OF ANIMALS.

## GENETIC MODIFICATION TECHNIQUES
GENETICALLY MODIFIED PLANTS ARE TYPICALLY PRODUCED USING MICROPROPAGATION, THOUGH SIMILAR TECHNIQUES DO NOT APPLY TO ANIMALS. SCIENTISTS HAVE DEVELOPED ALTERNATIVE METHODS FOR CREATING GENETICALLY MODIFIED ANIMALS BY INJECTING DNA INTO FERTILIZED EGGS, WHICH THEN DEVELOP INTO EMBRYOS AND ADULTS.

### BENEFITS OF GENETIC MODIFICATION
RESEARCH IN THIS FIELD OFFERS POTENTIAL BENEFITS, INCLUDING THE PRODUCTION OF HUMAN PROTEINS SUCH AS ANTIBODIES AND AAT, INCREASED AGRICULTURAL YIELDS, DISEASE RESISTANCE IN ANIMALS, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION FROM ANIMALS TO HUMANS.

## FIGURE 21.9
THE DIAGRAM ILLUSTRATES THE PROCESS OF PRODUCING GENETICALLY MODIFIED ANIMALS THROUGH DNA INJECTION INTO FERTILIZED EGGS, PLACEMENT IN SURROGATE MOTHERS, AND GENE TESTING IN YOUNG MICE. THIS RESEARCH CONTINUES TO EVOLVE, OFFERING PROMISING ADVANCEMENTS IN MEDICINE AND AGRICULTURE.

# MICROORGANISMS AND GENETIC MODIFICATION

## GENETIC MODIFICATION

### LOOKING AHEAD

THE POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR) IS A LABORATORY TECHNIQUE USED TO AMPLIFY DNA. IT RAPIDLY PRODUCES LARGE QUANTITIES OF SPECIFIC DNA FROM A SMALL SAMPLE, REVOLUTIONIZING GENE TECHNOLOGY ACROSS VARIOUS FIELDS.

EACH PCR CYCLE DOUBLES THE DNA, LEADING TO EXPONENTIAL GROWTH. FOR INSTANCE, AFTER 30 CYCLES, OVER A BILLION COPIES CAN BE GENERATED.

#### HOW PCR WORKS

PCR BEGINS WITH A SMALL DNA SAMPLE. THE PROCESS INVOLVES:

1. HEATING DNA STRANDS APART.
2. ADDING PRIMERS, SHORT SEQUENCES COMPLEMENTARY TO TARGET DNA ENDS.
3. USING DNA POLYMERASE TO SYNTHESIZE NEW STRANDS, CREATING TWO COPIES PER CYCLE.

THE PROGRESSION IS AS FOLLOWS:
- AFTER 1ST CYCLE: 2 COPIES
- AFTER 2ND CYCLE: 4 COPIES
- AFTER 3RD CYCLE: 8 COPIES
- AFTER 4TH CYCLE: 16 COPIES

PCR IS NOW AUTOMATED, OFTEN COMPLETED IN 2-3 HOURS USING A MACHINE THAT PROCESSES SAMPLES WITH NECESSARY COMPONENTS. THIS TECHNIQUE IS FUNDAMENTAL TO ADVANCEMENTS IN GENETICS, FORENSICS, AND MEDICAL DIAGNOSTICS.

## THE POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR)

PCR'S INVENTION HAS BEEN PIVOTAL IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, ENABLING SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ACROSS VARIOUS APPLICATIONS. ITS ABILITY TO EXPONENTIALLY AMPLIFY DNA MAKES IT INDISPENSABLE IN MODERN SCIENCE.

# MICROORGANISMS AND GENETIC MODIFICATION

## CHAPTER QUESTIONS

### GENETIC MODIFICATION

GENETIC MODIFICATION IS A POWERFUL TOOL IN BIOTECHNOLOGY THAT ALLOWS SCIENTISTS TO ALTER THE GENETIC MAKEUP OF ORGANISMS. THIS PROCESS IS PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE IN MICROORGANISMS, SUCH AS BACTERIA.

BACTERIA ARE RELATIVELY EASY TO GENETICALLY MODIFY DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS. THEY CAN TAKE UP PLASMIDS, WHICH ARE SMALL CIRCULAR DNA MOLECULES THAT CAN CARRY GENES USEFUL FOR THE ORGANISM. ADDITIONALLY, THEIR SIMPLE STRUCTURE, CONSISTING OF A SINGLE CHROMOSOME, FACILITATES GENETIC MANIPULATION. THESE CHARACTERISTICS MAKE BACTERIA AN IDEAL MODEL FOR STUDYING AND APPLYING GENETIC CHANGES.

### PRODUCTION OF HUMAN INSULIN FROM GENETICALLY MODIFIED BACTERIA

THE PRODUCTION OF HUMAN INSULIN FROM GENETICALLY MODIFIED BACTERIA INVOLVES SEVERAL KEY STEPS:

1. DNA ENCODING INSULIN IS INSERTED INTO PLASMIDS.
2. BACTERIA ARE CLONED TO ENSURE UNIFORMITY.
3. PLASMIDS, NOW CONTAINING THE INSULIN GENE, ARE INTRODUCED INTO THE BACTERIA.
4. USING RESTRICTION ENZYMES, THE DNA FOR INSULIN IS EXTRACTED FROM THE PLASMIDS.

THE CORRECT SEQUENCE OF THESE STEPS IS AS FOLLOWS: FIRST, THE PLASMID DNA IS CUT WITH A RESTRICTION ENZYME (STEP 4), THEN THE PLASMID IS INSERTED INTO THE BACTERIA (STEP 3), FOLLOWED BY CLONING THE BACTERIA (STEP 2), AND FINALLY INSERTING THE INSULIN GENE INTO THE PLASMID (STEP 1). THIS SEQUENCE ENSURES THAT THE INSULIN GENE IS CORRECTLY EXPRESSED IN THE BACTERIA.

### GENETICALLY MODIFIED PLANTS

SEVERAL TYPES OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED PLANTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN PRODUCED:

- RICE RICH IN BETA-CAROTENE TO ENHANCE VITAMIN A PRODUCTION.
- PLANTS RESISTANT TO WEEDKILLER.
- PLANTS CONTAINING AN ANTI-FREEZE PROTEIN TO SURVIVE IN COLD ENVIRONMENTS.
- CEREALS WITH NITROGEN-FIXING BACTERIA IN ROOT NODULES.

THE ONLY PLANT THAT HAS NOT BEEN GENETICALLY MODIFIED IS CEREALS WITH NITROGEN-FIXING BACTERIA IN THEIR ROOT SYSTEMS. THIS MODIFICATION WOULD REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT ADVANCEMENTS IN GENETIC ENGINEERING TECHNIQUES.

### ENZYMES IN GENETIC MODIFICATION

IN GENETIC MODIFICATION, THE ENZYME USED TO JOIN PIECES OF DNA IS LIGASE. LIGASE CATALYZES THE FORMATION OF PHOSPHODIESTER BONDS BETWEEN DNA FRAGMENTS, ALLOWING THEM TO BE JOINED TOGETHER. OTHER ENZYMES, SUCH AS RESTRICTION ENZYMES, ARE USED TO CUT DNA AT SPECIFIC SITES, BUT THEY DO NOT JOIN DNA FRAGMENTS.

### REFERENCES

FOR MORE QUESTIONS ON GENE TECHNOLOGY, REFER TO UNIT 6 ON PAGE 256.

# MICROORGANISMS AND GENETIC MODIFICATION

## GENETIC MODIFICATION

GENETIC MODIFICATION INVOLVES ALTERING AN ORGANISM'S GENETIC MATERIAL TO ACHIEVE SPECIFIC TRAITS. ONE NOTABLE APPLICATION IS THE PRODUCTION OF HUMAN INSULIN USING BACTERIA.

### THE PROCESS OF GENETIC MODIFICATION

THE PROCESS OF TRANSFERRING THE HUMAN INSULIN GENE INTO A BACTERIUM INVOLVES SEVERAL KEY STEPS:

1. **EXTRACTING THE GENE**: THE HUMAN INSULIN GENE IS EXTRACTED FROM CELLS THAT NATURALLY PRODUCE INSULIN.
2. **PLASMID PREPARATION**: A PLASMID, A SMALL CIRCULAR DNA MOLECULE FROM BACTERIA, IS CUT USING SPECIFIC ENZYMES AND THEN INSERTED WITH THE HUMAN INSULIN GENE.
3. **REINTRODUCTION INTO BACTERIA**: THE MODIFIED PLASMID IS REINTRODUCED INTO THE BACTERIUM, ENABLING IT TO PRODUCE HUMAN INSULIN.

### QUESTIONS FOR ANALYSIS

- **ENZYMES USED**: THE ENZYMES USED AT STAGES 1 AND 2 ARE RESTRICTION ENZYMES.
- **ROLE OF PLASMID**: THE PLASMID ACTS AS A VECTOR TO CARRY THE HUMAN INSULIN GENE INTO THE BACTERIUM.
- **INSULIN PRODUCTION**: THE BACTERIA, NOW CAPABLE OF PRODUCING HUMAN INSULIN, CAN BE CULTURED IN LARGE QUANTITIES TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT INSULIN.

### REASONING SKILLS

UNDERSTANDING WHY THIS METHOD IS PREFERRED OVER EXTRACTING INSULIN FROM ANIMALS INVOLVES SEVERAL FACTORS:

- **PREVENTION OF ALLERGIC REACTIONS**: INSULIN FROM TRANSGENIC BACTERIA AVOIDS POTENTIAL ALLERGIES ASSOCIATED WITH ANIMAL-DERIVED INSULIN.
- **COST-EFFECTIVENESS**: BACTERIAL PRODUCTION IS MORE ECONOMICAL THAN TRADITIONAL METHODS, MAKING INSULIN MORE ACCESSIBLE.

### RESEARCH TASK

INTRAPERSONAL RESEARCH SHOULD EXPLORE THE USE OF TRANSGENIC ANIMALS FOR ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION. CONSIDER ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST THEIR USE, INCLUDING ETHICAL CONCERNS.

### CRITICAL THINKING

GENETIC MODIFICATION IN PLANTS AND ANIMALS IS MORE COMPLEX THAN IN BACTERIA:

- **INTRODUCING GENES INTO PLANTS**: TWO COMMON METHODS ARE USING AGROBACTERIUM TUMEFACIENS OR PARTICLE BOMBARDMENT (GENE GUN).
- **PRODUCING ORGANISMS FROM CELLS**: GENETICALLY MODIFIED PLANT CELLS CAN BE GROWN INTO WHOLE ORGANISMS.
- **MODIFIED ANIMAL CELL**: TYPICALLY, SOMATIC CELLS OF MAMMALS ARE USED FOR MODIFICATION.

### ESSAY ASSIGNMENT

AN ESSAY ON GENETIC ENGINEERING SHOULD ADDRESS:

- BENEFITS IN ANIMALS AND PLANTS, SUCH AS DISEASE RESISTANCE AND IMPROVED NUTRITIONAL CONTENT.
- RISKS, INCLUDING ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS AND ETHICAL CONCERNS REGARDING HUMAN CLONING.

BY EXPLORING THESE CONCEPTS, STUDENTS GAIN INSIGHT INTO GENETIC MODIFICATION'S SIGNIFICANCE IN SCIENCE, HEALTH, AGRICULTURE, AND ETHICS.

# MICROORGANISMS AND GENETIC MODIFICATION

## UNIT QUESTIONS

### INTRODUCTION
MICROORGANISMS PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN GENETIC MODIFICATION, PARTICULARLY IN INSULIN PRODUCTION. THEY ARE CULTIVATED USING FERMENTERS DESIGNED FOR EFFICIENT GROWTH.

### THE FERMENTER
A TYPICAL FERMENTER USED FOR GROWING MICROORGANISMS INCLUDES SEVERAL COMPONENTS:

- **STIRRING MOTOR**: ENSURES EVEN MIXING OF THE CULTURE.
- **COOLING JACKET**: MAINTAINS A CONSTANT TEMPERATURE.
- **AIR SUPPLY**: PROVIDES OXYGEN NECESSARY FOR AEROBIC RESPIRATION.
- **PRODUCT OUT**: WHERE THE INSULIN IS COLLECTED.
- **COOLING WATER IN/OUT**: REGULATES TEMPERATURE.

### QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER
1. **WHY IS AIR PUMPED THROUGH THE FERMENTER?**  
   AIR PROVIDES OXYGEN ESSENTIAL FOR MICROORGANISM GROWTH AND METABOLISM.

2. **WHY IS IT NECESSARY TO KEEP THE TEMPERATURE IN THE FERMENTER CONSTANT?**  
   CONSTANT TEMPERATURE ENSURES OPTIMAL ENZYME ACTIVITY AND PREVENTS MICROORGANISM DEATH.

3. **SUGGEST ONE OTHER CONDITION THAT MUST BE KEPT CONSTANT INSIDE THE FERMENTER:**  
   THE PH LEVEL IS CRUCIAL FOR MICROORGANISM HEALTH.

4. **WHY IS STERILISING THE FERMENTER BY STEAM BETTER THAN USING DISINFECTANTS?**  
   STEAM EFFECTIVELY KILLS ALL MICROORGANISMS WITHOUT HARMFUL RESIDUES.

### ADVANTAGES OF USING MICROORGANISMS
USING MICROORGANISMS FOR INSULIN PRODUCTION OFFERS SEVERAL ADVANTAGES:
- COST-EFFECTIVENESS THROUGH LARGE-SCALE, LOW-COST CULTIVATION.
- ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS BY AVOIDING ANIMAL SOURCING ISSUES.

### KEY TERMS
- **PLASMID**: A SMALL, CIRCULAR DNA SEGMENT IN BACTERIA THAT CAN REPLICATE INDEPENDENTLY AND IS USED IN GENETIC ENGINEERING.
- **BACTERIOPHAGE**: A VIRUS THAT INFECTS BACTERIA, USED TO TRANSFER GENETIC MATERIAL IN GENETIC ENGINEERING.

### IMPORTANCE OF ENZYMES
RESTRICTION ENZYMES CUT DNA AT SPECIFIC SEQUENCES, ALLOWING GENE REMOVAL OR INSERTION. LIGASE ENZYMES JOIN DNA FRAGMENTS, FACILITATING RECOMBINANT DNA CREATION.
