# PLANT PHYSIOLOGY: TRANSPORT IN PLANTS

## INTRODUCTION
THIS CHAPTER EXPLORES HOW WATER AND OTHER SUBSTANCES MOVE WITHIN PLANTS. IT EXAMINES OSMOSIS, THE TRANSPORT OF WATER THROUGH XYLEM, AND THE MOVEMENT OF SUGARS VIA PHLOEM.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES
BY STUDYING THIS CHAPTER, YOU WILL:
- UNDERSTAND HOW OSMOSIS FACILITATES WATER MOVEMENT ACROSS CELL MEMBRANES.
- INVESTIGATE OSMOSIS IN BOTH LIVING CELLS, SUCH AS PLANT CELLS, AND ARTIFICIAL SYSTEMS LIKE VISKING TUBING.
- DESCRIBE THE ROLE OF PHLOEM IN TRANSPORTING SUCROSE AND AMINO ACIDS FROM LEAVES TO OTHER PLANT PARTS.
- EXPLAIN THE FUNCTION OF XYLEM IN MOVING WATER AND MINERAL IONS FROM ROOTS TO OTHER AREAS.
- RECOGNIZE THE SOURCES AND LOSS OF CARBON DIOXIDE AND OXYGEN AS METABOLIC WASTE THROUGH STOMATA.

## OSMOSIS
OSMOSIS REFERS TO THE MOVEMENT OF WATER ACROSS SEMI-PERMEABLE MEMBRANES. THIS PROCESS IS CRUCIAL FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW WATER MOVES WITHIN PLANT CELLS.

### MECHANISM OF OSMOSIS
OSMOSIS OCCURS WHEN A SEMI-PERMEABLE MEMBRANE SEPARATES TWO SOLUTIONS, ALLOWING SMALLER MOLECULES LIKE WATER TO PASS THROUGH WHILE RESTRICTING LARGER MOLECULES SUCH AS SUCROSE. VISKING TUBING EXEMPLIFIES THIS PROPERTY WITH ITS MICROSCOPIC PORES THAT PERMIT WATER BUT NOT SUCROSE.

## OSMOSIS DEMONSTRATION
THIS EXPERIMENT ILLUSTRATES OSMOSIS USING VISKING TUBING:

1. FILL THE TUBING WITH A CONCENTRATED SUCROSE SOLUTION.
2. ATTACH IT TO A CAPILLARY TUBE.
3. PLACE THE TUBING IN A BEAKER OF WATER.

THE RED DYE ADDED TO THE TUBING HIGHLIGHTS THE VISIBLE MOVEMENT OF WATER, DEMONSTRATING OSMOSIS'S PRINCIPLES IN PLANT TRANSPORT.

## XYLEM AND PHLOEM TRANSPORT
XYLEM TRANSPORTS WATER AND MINERALS FROM ROOTS TO OTHER PLANT PARTS VIA OSMOSIS. PHLOEM THEN MOVES SUGARS AND AMINO ACIDS FROM LEAVES TO STORAGE TISSUES, FACILITATING ENERGY DISTRIBUTION AND NUTRIENT TRANSPORT.

## TRANSPORT IN PLANTS

### KEY CONCEPTS

**DIFFUSION** IS THE NET MOVEMENT OF PARTICLES (MOLECULES OR IONS) ACROSS A CONCENTRATION GRADIENT DRIVEN BY THEIR KINETIC ENERGY. THIS PRINCIPLE IS FUNDAMENTAL FOR UNDERSTANDING SUBSTANCE TRANSPORT WITHIN PLANTS.

**OSMOSIS** REFERS TO THE NET DIFFUSION OF WATER MOLECULES ACROSS A PARTIALLY PERMEABLE MEMBRANE FROM A SOLUTION WITH HIGHER WATER POTENTIAL TO ONE WITH LOWER WATER POTENTIAL. THIS PROCESS DOES NOT REQUIRE PURE WATER ON EITHER SIDE; ONLY A CONCENTRATION DIFFERENCE AND A SUITABLE MEMBRANE ARE NECESSARY FOR OSMOSIS TO OCCUR.

### UNDERSTANDING OSMOSIS

IN PRACTICAL EXAMPLES, SUCH AS THOSE INVOLVING VISKING TUBING SEPARATING TWO LIQUIDS, OSMOSIS CAN BE OBSERVED. WATER MOVES FROM THE PURE WATER SIDE (LEFT) INTO THE SUCROSE SOLUTION (RIGHT), CAUSING THE WATER LEVEL IN THE CAPILLARY TUBE TO RISE DUE TO OSMOTIC PRESSURE.

!OSMOSIS MODEL
*FIGURE 11.2: IN THIS MODEL OF OSMOSIS, MORE WATER MOLECULES DIFFUSE FROM LEFT TO RIGHT THAN FROM RIGHT TO LEFT.*

### MECHANISM OF OSMOSIS

1. **WATER MOLECULE MOVEMENT**: PURE WATER ALLOWS UNRESTRICTED PASSAGE THROUGH THE MEMBRANE DUE TO HIGHER WATER POTENTIAL.

2. **SUCROSE SOLUTION INTERACTION**: THE SUCROSE MOLECULES ON THE RIGHT ATTRACT WATER MOLECULES, REDUCING THEIR KINETIC ENERGY AND LIMITING THEIR MOVEMENT.

3. **WATER POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE**: THIS ATTRACTION CAUSES A NET FLOW OF WATER FROM THE HIGH-POTENTIAL (LEFT) SIDE TO THE LOW-POTENTIAL (RIGHT) SIDE.

### WATER POTENTIAL

**WATER POTENTIAL** INDICATES THE FREEDOM OF WATER MOLECULES TO MOVE. PURE WATER HAS THE HIGHEST POTENTIAL, WHILE MORE CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS HAVE LOWER POTENTIALS DUE TO SOLUTE INTERACTIONS.

### DEFINITION OF OSMOSIS

OSMOSIS IS DEFINED AS THE NET DIFFUSION OF WATER ACROSS A PARTIALLY PERMEABLE MEMBRANE FROM A SOLUTION WITH HIGHER WATER POTENTIAL TO ONE WITH LOWER WATER POTENTIAL. THIS CONCEPT IS CRUCIAL FOR STUDYING PLANT WATER ABSORPTION AND INTERNAL BALANCE.

# PLANT PHYSIOLOGY: TRANSPORT IN PLANTS

## OSMOSIS IN PLANT CELLS

OSMOSIS IS A PROCESS THAT OCCURS NOT ONLY THROUGH VISKING TUBING BUT ALSO WITHIN PLANT CELLS. THE CELL SURFACE MEMBRANES OF BOTH ANIMAL AND PLANT CELLS FUNCTION AS PARTIAL BARRIERS, AS DOES THE INNER MEMBRANE SURROUNDING THE PLANT CELL'S SAP VACUOLE.

### MEMBRANES IN ANIMAL AND PLANT CELLS

ANIMAL AND PLANT CELLS SHARE STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS, INCLUDING THEIR NUCLEI AND CYTOPLASM. HOWEVER, PLANT CELLS HAVE ADDITIONAL FEATURES THAT SET THEM APART:

- **PLANT CELL COMPONENTS**: NUCLEUS, CYTOPLASM, CELL SURFACE MEMBRANE, CELLULOSE CELL WALL, INNER MEMBRANE AROUND THE SAP VACUOLE, AND THE SAP VACUOLE ITSELF.

THE CELL WALL IN PLANTS IS COMPOSED OF CELLULOSE, ALLOWING WATER AND SOLUTES TO PASS THROUGH ITS LARGE PORES. IN CONTRAST, THE CELL MEMBRANES ARE PARTIALLY PERMEABLE, FACILITATING OSMOSIS WHILE RESTRICTING CERTAIN SUBSTANCES.

### KEY POINT

THE CELL WALL'S STRUCTURE IS CRUCIAL FOR SUPPORTING PLANT CELLS. IT PROVIDES RIGIDITY AND PREVENTS EXCESSIVE SWELLING OR SHRINKING DUE TO OSMOTIC CHANGES. THIS STRUCTURAL ROLE IS VITAL FOR MAINTAINING PLANT INTEGRITY IN DIVERSE ENVIRONMENTS.

PLANT CELLS CONTAIN NUMEROUS SOLUTES WITHIN THEIR SAP VACUOLES, INCLUDING SUGARS AND IONS, WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR OSMOTIC POTENTIAL.

### EFFECTS OF OSMOSIS ON PLANT CELLS

WHEN PLACED IN PURE WATER OR A DILUTE SOLUTION, PLANT CELLS ABSORB WATER VIA OSMOSIS BECAUSE THEIR CELLULAR CONTENT HAS A LOWER WATER POTENTIAL. THIS RESULTS IN THE CELL BECOMING TURGID—SWELLING DUE TO INTERNAL PRESSURE AGAINST THE CELL WALL.

IN CONTRAST, WHEN EXPOSED TO CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS, PLANTS LOSE WATER, LEADING TO CELL FLACCIDITY. PROLONGED DEHYDRATION CAN CAUSE PLASMOLYSIS, WHERE THE CELL MEMBRANE SEPARATES FROM THE CELL WALL, ALTERING CELLULAR STRUCTURE.

THIS UNDERSTANDING IS FUNDAMENTAL FOR GRASPING HOW PLANTS MAINTAIN THEIR STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL INTEGRITY UNDER VARYING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS.

# PLANT PHYSIOLOGY: TRANSPORT IN PLANTS

## OSMOSIS IN PLANT CELLS

OSMOSIS REFERS TO THE MOVEMENT OF WATER ACROSS A SEMI-PERMEABLE MEMBRANE FROM AN AREA OF HIGHER WATER POTENTIAL TO LOWER. WHEN PLANT CELLS ARE PLACED IN A CONCENTRATED SUCROSE SOLUTION, THEY LOSE WATER, LEADING TO A DECREASE IN CELL VOLUME AND A CONDITION CALLED **FLACCIDITY**, WHERE THE CYTOPLASM NO LONGER PRESSES AGAINST THE CELL WALL.

## PLASMOLYSIS

CONTINUED WATER LOSS CAUSES THE CELL MEMBRANE TO SEPARATE FROM THE CELL WALL, CREATING GAPS. THIS PROCESS IS KNOWN AS **PLASMOLYSIS**. 

!FIGURE 11.5: ONION EPIDERMIS CELLS SHOWING PLASMOLYSIS, WITH MEMBRANES AND CYTOPLASM PULLED AWAY FROM THE CELL WALL.

## KEY POINT

WHILE OSMOSIS OCCURS IN BOTH PLANT AND ANIMAL CELLS, WATER MOVEMENT IS MORE PRONOUNCED IN PLANTS DUE TO THEIR RIGID CELL WALLS. IN CONTRAST, ANIMAL CELLS LIKE RED BLOOD CELLS CAN SWELL OR BURST IN PURE WATER BUT SHRINK IN CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS.

!FIGURE 11.6: COMPARISON OF RED BLOOD CELLS IN A 3% SALT SOLUTION (RIGHT) VERSUS NORMAL STATE (LEFT). BLOOD PLASMA APPROXIMATES A 0.85% SALT CONCENTRATION.

## IMPORTANCE OF TURGOR PRESSURE

**TURGOR**, THE STATE WHERE PLANT CELLS ARE FIRM DUE TO INTERNAL WATER PRESSURE, PLAYS SEVERAL ROLES:

- SUPPORTS NON-WOODY STRUCTURES SUCH AS YOUNG STEMS AND LEAVES.
- HELPS MAINTAIN STEM UPRIGHTNESS, FACILITATING LEAF PHOTOSYNTHESIS.
- IS ESSENTIAL FOR STOMATAL FUNCTION, REGULATING GAS EXCHANGE.

WHEN PLANTS LOSE EXCESSIVE WATER AND CELLS BECOME FLACCID, THEY WILT. THIS REDUCES EXPOSED SURFACE AREA AND CLOSES STOMATA, CONSERVING WATER.

## WATER MOVEMENT IN PLANTS

WATER MOVES FROM CELL TO CELL VIA OSMOSIS ALONG A GRADIENT OF WATER POTENTIAL. STARTING FROM A CELL WITH HIGH WATER POTENTIAL, IT DIFFUSES THROUGH ADJACENT CELLS, DILUTING THEIR CONTENTS AND MOVING PROGRESSIVELY DOWN THE GRADIENT.

!FIGURE 11.7: WATER FLOWS FROM CELL A (HIGH POTENTIAL) TO B, THEN C, D, E, AND F, FOLLOWING A DECREASING WATER POTENTIAL GRADIENT.

UNDERSTANDING THESE PROCESSES IS CRUCIAL FOR GRASPING PLANT STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION IN DIVERSE ENVIRONMENTS.

## ACTIVITY 4: INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTS OF OSMOSIS ON POTATO TUBER TISSUE

### SAFETY NOTE  
TAKE CARE WHEN CUTTING THE POTATO INTO CHIPS AND WASH YOUR HANDS AFTERWARD.

### INTRODUCTION  
A POTATO TUBER IS A PLANT STORAGE ORGAN, MAKING IT SUITABLE FOR INVESTIGATING OSMOTIC EFFECTS. THIS EXPERIMENT WILL OBSERVE HOW POTATO CHIPS RESPOND IN DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS.

### MATERIALS NEEDED  
- BOILING TUBES  
- DISTILLED WATER  
- CONCENTRATED SUCROSE SOLUTION (E.G., 1 MOL PER DM³)  
- POTATO  
- BALANCE FOR WEIGHING  
- KNIFE  

### PROCEDURE  
1. **PREPARE POTATO CHIPS**: CUT THE POTATO INTO CHIPS MEASURING 5 CM X 1 CM X 1 CM, ENSURING ACCURACY AND REMOVING ALL SKIN.

2. **SET UP THE EXPERIMENT**:  
   - FILL ONE BOILING TUBE WITH DISTILLED WATER.  
   - FILL A SECOND WITH CONCENTRATED SUCROSE SOLUTION.  
   - LEAVE A THIRD EMPTY (EXPOSED TO AIR).

3. **MEASURE MASS**: GENTLY BLOT EACH CHIP TO REMOVE MOISTURE, THEN WEIGH AND RECORD STARTING MASS.

4. **PLACE CHIPS IN TUBES**: INSERT ONE CHIP INTO EACH OF THE THREE TUBES AS SHOWN IN FIGURE 11.9.

5. **OBSERVE CHANGES**: AFTER 30 MINUTES, REMOVE CHIPS, BLOT AGAIN, AND REWEIGH. NOTE FLEXIBILITY OR STIFFNESS.

### DATA COLLECTION  
CALCULATE THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN MASS USING:  
\[
\TEXT{PERCENTAGE CHANGE} = \LEFT( \FRAC{\DELTA \TEXT{MASS}}{\TEXT{STARTING MASS}} \RIGHT) \TIMES 100
\]

### RESULTS  
THE TABLE BELOW SHOWS RESULTS:

| TUBE CONTENTS      | STARTING MASS (G) | FINAL MASS (G) | ΔMASS (G) | ΔMASS (%) | CONDITION       |
|--------------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| DISTILLED WATER   | 6.25              | 6.76           | +0.51     | +8.16      | STIFF          |
| SUCROSE SOLUTION  | 7.10              | 6.31           | -0.79     | -11.1      | FLEXIBLE       |
| AIR                | 6.66              | 6.57           | -0.09     | -1.35      | STIFF          |

### CONCLUSION  
RESULTS INDICATE:  
- WATER INTAKE IN DISTILLED WATER CAUSED STIFFNESS.  
- MASS LOSS IN SUCROSE SOLUTION LED TO FLEXIBILITY.  
- MINIMAL CHANGE IN AIR, SUGGESTING LIMITED OSMOSIS.

### DISCUSSION QUESTIONS  
1. WHAT CONCLUSIONS CAN BE DRAWN FROM THE RESULTS?  
2. EXPLAIN OSMOTIC EFFECTS OBSERVED.  
3. COMPARE PERCENTAGE CHANGES WITH AIR-EXPOSED CHIPS.

# PLANT PHYSIOLOGY

## TRANSPORT IN PLANTS

### XYLEM

XYLEM IS A TYPE OF PLANT TISSUE RESPONSIBLE FOR TRANSPORTING WATER AND MINERALS THROUGHOUT THE PLANT. IT CONSISTS OF DEAD CELLS ARRANGED END-TO-END, FORMING CONTINUOUS VESSELS. WHEN MATURE, THESE VESSELS CONTAIN NO CYTOPLASM AND HAVE A HOLLOW CENTRAL SPACE, KNOWN AS THE LUMEN, THROUGH WHICH WATER PASSES. THE WALLS OF XYLEM VESSELS ARE REINFORCED WITH A WOODY MATERIAL CALLED LIGNIN, WHICH PROVIDES STRENGTH AND PREVENTS COLLAPSE, ALLOWING THE PLANT TO TRANSPORT WATER EFFICIENTLY, EVEN TO GREAT HEIGHTS.

THE KEY FEATURES OF XYLEM INCLUDE ITS COMPOSITION OF DEAD CELLS WITH LIGNIN-IMPREGNATED WALLS, ITS FUNCTION OF TRANSPORTING WATER AND MINERALS FROM THE ROOTS TO THE REST OF THE PLANT, AND ITS STRUCTURAL ROLE AS HOLLOW TUBES THAT ARE STRONG AND IMPERMEABLE TO WATER. THESE VESSELS ARE VISIBLE IN CROSS-SECTIONS OF STEMS, WHERE THEIR SPIRAL AND RING STRUCTURES ARE STAINED RED DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF LIGNIN.

### PHLOEM

PHLOEM IS ANOTHER TYPE OF PLANT TISSUE, BUT IT CONSISTS OF LIVING CELLS AT ALL STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. THE PHLOEM TUBES ARE FORMED BY CELLS ARRANGED END-TO-END, WITH CELL WALLS MADE OF CELLULOSE. UNLIKE XYLEM, PHLOEM CELLS RETAIN THEIR CYTOPLASM. THE ENDS OF THESE CELLS ARE CONNECTED BY SIEVE PLATES, WHICH HAVE HOLES THAT ALLOW THE LIVING CYTOPLASM TO EXTEND THROUGH, LINKING EACH CELL TO FORM A LONG SIEVE TUBE.

THE KEY FEATURES OF PHLOEM INCLUDE ITS COMPOSITION OF LIVING CELLS WITH CELLULOSE WALLS AND SIEVE PLATES, ITS FUNCTION OF TRANSPORTING THE PRODUCTS OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS (SUCH AS SUGARS AND AMINO ACIDS) FROM THE LEAVES TO OTHER PARTS OF THE PLANT FOR ENERGY AND STORAGE, AND ITS RELIANCE ON COMPANION CELLS TO CONTROL THE SIEVE TUBES, WHICH LACK A NUCLEUS.

### SUMMARY OF TRANSPORT FUNCTIONS

XYLEM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CARRYING WATER AND MINERALS UPWARD FROM THE ROOTS, WHILE PHLOEM TRANSPORTS THE PRODUCTS OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS AWAY FROM THE LEAVES. PHLOEM ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO TRANSPORT SUBSTANCES BOTH UPWARDS AND DOWNWARDS IN THE PLANT, MAKING IT ESSENTIAL FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF NUTRIENTS AND ENERGY WITHIN THE PLANT.

### EXPERIMENTATION WITH PLANT TISSUES

YOU MAY CONDUCT AN EXPERIMENT TO OBSERVE THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT CONCENTRATIONS OF SUCROSE SOLUTIONS ON PLANT TISSUE, SUCH AS POTATO OR CARROT CHIPS. CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING:

- **TERMS TO USE:** FLACCID (WHEN THE CELLS LOSE WATER) AND TURGID (WHEN THE CELLS GAIN WATER).
- **CRITIQUE OF EXPERIMENT:** USING ONE CHIP PER TUBE MAY NOT YIELD RELIABLE EVIDENCE.
- **ALTERNATIVE MEASUREMENTS:** INSTEAD OF WEIGHING, YOU COULD MEASURE THE LENGTH OF THE CHIPS BEFORE AND AFTER THE EXPERIMENT, ALTHOUGH WEIGHING PROVIDES MORE ACCURATE RESULTS.

**EXPERIMENT PLANNING:**
1. **HYPOTHESIS:** PREDICT WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO CHIPS PLACED IN SOLUTIONS OF VARYING CONCENTRATIONS.
2. **METHOD:** OUTLINE THE APPARATUS AND MATERIALS NEEDED, DESCRIBE THE PROCEDURE, AND STATE THE EXPECTED RESULTS.

BY UNDERSTANDING THE ROLES OF XYLEM AND PHLOEM, YOU CAN APPRECIATE HOW PLANTS TRANSPORT ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS AND WATER, WHICH IS VITAL FOR THEIR GROWTH AND SURVIVAL.

# PLANT PHYSIOLOGY: TRANSPORT IN PLANTS

## STRUCTURE OF A STEM

IN A YOUNG STEM, XYLEM AND PHLOEM ARE GROUPED TOGETHER IN AREAS CALLED **VASCULAR BUNDLES**. UNLIKE IN THE ROOT, WHERE THE VASCULAR TISSUE IS CENTRALIZED, THESE BUNDLES ARE ARRANGED IN RINGS AROUND THE OUTER PART OF THE STEM (SEE FIGURE 11.12). THE CROSS-SECTION OF A STEM REVEALS THE ARRANGEMENT OF XYLEM AND PHLOEM TISSUES WITHIN THESE BUNDLES.

### VASCULAR BUNDLE COMPONENTS

- **PHLOEM**: CONSISTS OF BLUE-COLORED SIEVE TUBES.
- **XYLEM**: COMPOSED OF RED LIGNIFIED FIBERS FOR STRUCTURAL SUPPORT.
- **EPIDERMIS**: THE OUTER LAYER OF CELLS FORMING THE STEM'S SURFACE.
- **CORTEX**: A LAYER BENEATH THE EPIDERMIS, PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR NUTRIENT TRANSFER.
- **PITH**: FOUND IN OLDER STEMS, IT FORMS A CENTRAL CORE WITH XYLEM.

!FIGURE 11.12
(A) CROSS-SECTION SHOWING VASCULAR BUNDLES IN A STEM. (B) THREE VASCULAR BUNDLES WITH OUTER RED FIBERS AND INNER PHLOEM TUBES.

## KEY POINT

IN OLDER STEMS, VASCULAR TISSUE DEVELOPS INTO COMPLETE RINGS AROUND THE STEM. THE CENTRAL XYLEM FORMS THE WOODY CORE, SURROUNDED BY PHLOEM, PROVIDING STRUCTURAL SUPPORT AND FACILITATING NUTRIENT TRANSPORT.

- VASCULAR REFERS TO VESSELS OR TUBES.
- A VASCULAR BUNDLE IS A GROUP OF INTERCONNECTED XYLEM AND PHLOEM TISSUES.

## CHAPTER QUESTIONS

FOR MORE QUESTIONS ON PLANT TRANSPORT MECHANISMS, REFER TO UNIT 3, PAGE 159.

## SKILLS: CRITICAL THINKING

A PLANT CELL WAS PLACED IN CONCENTRATED SUCROSE SOLUTION. AFTER AN HOUR, THE CELL'S APPEARANCE CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY. THE OPTIONS FOR DESCRIPTION ARE:

- A) TURGID
- B) FLACCID
- C) PLASMOLYSED
- D) WILTED

THIS STRUCTURED FORMAT PROVIDES A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF PLANT TRANSPORT PROCESSES AND CELLULAR RESPONSES TO EXTERNAL SOLUTIONS.

# PLANT PHYSIOLOGY: TRANSPORT IN PLANTS

## FUNCTIONS OF XYLEM AND PHLOEM
THE XYLEM TRANSPORTS WATER AND MINERAL IONS FROM THE ROOTS TO OTHER PARTS OF THE PLANT, WHILE THE PHLOEM TRANSPORTS SUGARS PRODUCED IN THE LEAVES TO OTHER TISSUES WHERE THEY ARE NEEDED FOR GROWTH AND ENERGY. THIS DISTINCTION ALLOWS PLANTS TO EFFICIENTLY MOVE BOTH WATER AND NUTRIENTS ACROSS DIFFERENT CELLULAR REGIONS.

## EXPERIMENT WITH POTATO CHIPS

THREE POTATO CHIPS WERE IMMERSED IN SOLUTIONS A, B, OR C CONTAINING VARYING CONCENTRATIONS OF SUCROSE. THE RESULTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN MASS DUE TO OSMOSIS.

1. **PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN MASS FOR SOLUTION B:**  
   THE CHIP IN SOLUTION B EXPERIENCED A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY 3.87% OF ITS INITIAL MASS, CALCULATED AS ((8.2 - 8.0)/8.2) * 100%.

2. **PROCESS CAUSING THE MASS CHANGE:**  
   THE CHANGE IN MASS IS ATTRIBUTED TO OSMOSIS, WHERE WATER MOLECULES MOVED FROM THE CHIP INTO SOLUTION B IF THE SOLUTION'S SOLUTE CONCENTRATION WAS HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE POTATO CELLS. SOLUTIONS A AND C CAUSED A LOSS OR GAIN IN MASS DUE TO THIS PROCESS.

3. **MOST CONCENTRATED SOLUTION:**  
   SOLUTION C LIKELY HAD THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF SUCROSE, AS IT CAUSED THE GREATEST INCREASE IN MASS, INDICATING MORE SOLUTES WERE AVAILABLE FOR OSMOSIS.

4. **SOLUTION WITH HIGHEST WATER POTENTIAL:**  
   SOLUTION A HAD THE LOWEST WATER POTENTIAL, AS THE POTATO CHIP LOST MASS WHEN PLACED IN THIS SOLUTION, INDICATING THAT ITS WATER POTENTIAL WAS LOWER THAN THE CELL'S OWN WATER POTENTIAL.

5. **SOLUTION MOST SIMILAR TO POTATO CELLS' WATER POTENTIAL:**  
   SOLUTIONS B AND C LIKELY HAD WATER POTENTIALS SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE POTATO CELLS, AS THERE WAS NO NET CHANGE IN MASS FOR CHIPS PLACED IN THESE SOLUTIONS.

## UNDERSTANDING CELL MEMBRANES
THE TERM "PARTIALLY PERMEABLE" REFERS TO THE CELL MEMBRANE'S SELECTIVE BARRIER PROPERTIES. IT ALLOWS CERTAIN SUBSTANCES, LIKE OXYGEN AND WATER, TO PASS THROUGH WHILE RESTRICTING OTHERS, SUCH AS LARGER MOLECULES OR IONS, ENSURING THAT CELLULAR PROCESSES CAN OCCUR EFFICIENTLY WITHOUT INTERFERENCE FROM UNWANTED MATERIALS.

## PLANT STEM STRUCTURE
A CROSS-SECTIONAL DIAGRAM OF A PLANT STEM REVEALS THREE DISTINCT TISSUES: THE EPIDERMIS (OUTERMOST LAYER), THE CORTEX (MIDDLE LAYER), AND THE VASCULAR TISSUES (INNERMOST LAYER). THE VASCULAR TISSUES CONSIST OF XYLEM FOR WATER TRANSPORT AND PHLOEM FOR SUGAR TRANSPORT.

**REASONING QUESTION:**  
IF A YOUNG STEM IS PLACED IN A RED DYE SOLUTION, THE DYE WOULD LIKELY BE ABSORBED BY THE EPIDERMIS. THIS TISSUE FORMS A PROTECTIVE COVERING, ALLOWING IT TO TAKE UP DYE MORE QUICKLY THAN THE INNER TISSUES DUE TO ITS LOCATION ON THE STEM'S SURFACE.
