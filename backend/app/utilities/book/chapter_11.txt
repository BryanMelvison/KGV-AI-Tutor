# 11 TRANSPORT IN PLANTS

Chapter 10 described how plants make food by photosynthesis. Photosynthesis requires water from the roots to be transported to the leaves, and sugars and other products of photosynthesis to be transported away from the leaves to the rest of the plant. This chapter explains how these materials are moved through the plant.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

- Understand how water can move in or out of plant cells by osmosis
- Investigate osmosis in living and non-living systems (plant cells and Visking tubing)
- Describe the role of the xylem in the transport of water and mineral ions from the roots to other parts of a plant
- Describe the role of phloem in the transport of sucrose and amino acids from the leaves to other parts of a plant
- Understand the origin of carbon dioxide and oxygen as waste products of metabolism and their loss from the stomata of a leaf

## OSMOSIS

Osmosis is the name of a process by which water moves into and out of cells. In order to understand how water moves through a plant, you need to understand the mechanism of osmosis. Osmosis happens when a material called a partially permeable membrane separates two solutions. One artificial partially permeable membrane is called Visking tubing. This is used in kidney dialysis machines. Visking tubing has microscopic holes in it, which let small molecules like water pass through (it is permeable to them) but is not permeable to some larger molecules, such as the sugar sucrose. This is why it is called 'partially' permeable. You can show the effects of osmosis by filling a Visking tubing 'sausage' with concentrated sucrose solution, attaching it to a capillary tube and placing the Visking tubing in a beaker of water (Figure 11.1).

| Component           | Description                                    |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Capillary tube      | Attached to the top of the Visking tubing      |
| Cotton thread       | Tied tightly around the Visking tubing         |
| Water               | Surrounds the Visking tubing in the beaker     |
| Sucrose solution    | Concentrated solution inside the Visking tubing|
| Visking tubing      | Contains the sucrose solution                  |
| Knot tied in tubing | Seals the bottom of the Visking tubing         |

Figure 11.1 Water enters the Visking tubing 'sausage' by osmosis. This causes the level of liquid in the capillary tube to rise. In the photograph, the contents of the Visking tubing have had a red dye added to make it easier to see the movement of the liquid.

                                          The level in the capillary tube rises as water moves from the beaker to the
                                          inside of the Visking tubing: This movement is due to osmosis. You can
                                         understand what's happening if you imagine a highly magnified view of the
                                          Visking tubing separating the two liquids (Figure 11.2).

## OSMOSIS IN PLANT CELLS

So far we have only been dealing with osmosis through Visking tubing. However, there are partially permeable membranes in cells too. The cell surface membranes of both animal and plant cells are partially permeable, and so is the inner membrane around the plant cell's sap vacuole (Figure 11.3).

### Figure 11.3 Membranes in animal and plant cells

| Animal Cell | Plant Cell |
|-------------|------------|
| - Cytoplasm | - Inner membrane around sap vacuole |
| - Cell surface membrane | - Cell surface membrane |
| - Nucleus | - Cellulose cell wall |
|           | - Sap vacuole |
|           | - Cytoplasm |
|           | - Nucleus |

### KEY POINT

The cell wall has large holes in it, making it fully permeable to water and solutes. Only the cell membranes are partially permeable barriers that allow osmosis to take place.

Around the plant cell is the tough cellulose cell wall. This outer structure keeps the shape of the cell, and can resist changes in pressure inside the cell. This is very important, and critical in explaining the way that plants are supported. The cell contents, including the sap vacuole, contain many dissolved solutes, such as sugars and ions.

If a plant cell is put into pure water or a dilute solution, the contents of the cell have a lower water potential than the external solution, so the cell will absorb water by osmosis (Figure 11.4). The cell then swells up and the cytoplasm pushes against the cell wall. A plant cell that has developed an internal pressure like this is called turgid.

### Figure 11.4 The effects of osmosis on plant cells

| Cell placed in dilute solution, or water; absorbs water by osmosis and becomes turgid | Cell placed in concentrated solution loses water by osmosis and becomes flaccid | Excessive loss of water by osmosis causes the cell to become plasmolysed |

| - Vacuole (enlarged) | - Vacuole (shrinking) | - Vacuole (severely shrunk) |
| - Cell wall | - Cell wall | - Cell wall |
---
On the other hand, if the cell is placed in a concentrated sucrose solution that has a lower water potential than the cell contents, it will lose water by osmosis. The cell decreases in volume and the cytoplasm no longer pushes against the cell wall. In this state, the cell is called flaccid. Eventually the cell contents shrink so much that the membrane and cytoplasm split away from the cell wall and gaps appear between the wall and the membrane. A cell like this is called plasmolysed. You can see plasmolysis happening in the plant cells shown in Figure 11.5. The space between the cell wall and the cell surface membrane will now be filled with the sucrose solution.

Figure 11.5 shows cells of onion epidermis, demonstrating plasmolysis. The cell membranes and cytoplasm can be seen to have pulled away from the cell wall.

### KEY POINT

This chapter only covers plant cells. Osmosis also happens in animal cells, but there is much less water movement. This is because animal cells do not have a strong cell wall around them, and can't resist the changes in internal pressure resulting from large movements of water. For example, if red blood cells are put into water, they will swell up and burst. If the same cells are put into a concentrated salt solution, they lose water by osmosis and shrink, producing cells with crinkly edges (Figure 11.6).

Figure 11.6 compares the red blood cells on the right, which were placed in a 3% salt solution, with the normal cells on the left. Blood plasma has a concentration equal to a 0.85% salt solution.

Turgor (the state a plant is in when its cells are turgid) is very important to plants. The pressure inside the cells pushes neighbouring cells against each other, like a box full of inflated balloons. This supports the non-woody parts of the plant, such as young stems and leaves, and holds stems upright, so the leaves can carry out photosynthesis properly. Turgor is also important in the functioning of stomata. If a plant loses too much water from its cells so that they become flaccid, this makes the plant wilt. You can see wilting in a pot plant which has been left for too long without water. The leaves droop and collapse. In fact this is a protective action. It cuts down water loss by reducing the exposed surface area of the leaves and closing the stomata.

Inside the plant, water moves from cell to cell by osmosis. If a cell has a higher water potential than the cell next to it, water will move from the first cell to the second. In turn, this will dilute the contents of the second cell, so that it has a higher water potential than the next cell. In this way, water can move across a plant tissue, down a gradient of water potential (Figure 11.7).

Figure 11.7 illustrates how water moves from cell to cell down a water potential gradient:

## ACTIVITY 3

### PRACTICAL: INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTS OF OSMOSIS IN ONION EPIDERMIS CELLS

> Safety note: Wash hands after handling and preparing the onion. Microscopes using a mirror for daylight illumination must never be placed where direct sunlight might strike the mirror otherwise permanent retinal damage may occur.

A drop of concentrated (1 mol per dm³) sucrose solution is placed on one microscope slide, and a drop of distilled water on a second slide. Two small squares of inner epidermis are removed from the outer fleshy layers of an onion (Figure 11.8). One square is transferred to the sucrose solution, and the second to the water. This is done as quickly as possible, so that the cells do not dry out.

![Figure 11.8 Investigating osmosis in onion epidermis cells]

A drop of the correct solution is added to the top of each specimen, followed by a cover slip. Any excess liquid is blotted (cleaned) up with filter paper.

Each slide is examined through the microscope for several minutes. The specimen in water will show turgid cells, similar to the first cell in Figure 11.4. The cells in sucrose solution will gradually plasmolyse, as shown in the last diagram of Figure 11.4, and Figure 11.5.

It is interesting to replace the sugar solution on the first slide with distilled water, to see the effect on the plasmolysed cells. This can be done quite easily without removing the cover slip. Some water is placed on one side of the cover slip and drawn across the slide using filter paper, as shown in Figure 11.8. After a while all the sucrose solution is replaced by water. If the cells are now observed for a few minutes, they will gradually recover from their plasmolysed condition until they are fully turgid again.

It may be possible for you to carry out these procedures. If you can, observe and draw one or two turgid cells, and one or two that are plasmolysed.

Can you explain all these observations in terms of osmosis?

If you use a red onion, the contents of the cells are coloured and easier to see.

---
Can you explain the final 'condition' of the chips, using terms such as 'flaccid' and 'turgid'?

Can you think of any criticisms of this experiment? For example, does using one chip per tube yield reliable evidence?

You may be able to perform an experiment similar to the one above. You don't have to use potato; other tissues such as carrot or sweet potato should work. An alternative to weighing is to measure the length of the chips at the end of the experiment, and compare these measurements with the starting lengths. However, weighing is much more accurate and gives a bigger percentage change.

You could try extending the experiment into a more complete investigation. For example you could make predictions about what would happen to chips placed in solutions that are intermediate in concentration between water and molar sucrose solution.

Plan a method to test your hypothesis. You should include a list of the apparatus and materials to be used, a description of the procedure, and a statement of the expected results.

## TRANSPORT IN THE XYLEM

Xylem transports water and minerals throughout the plant. Xylem contains dead cells arranged end-to-end, forming continuous vessels. When they are mature, the vessels contain no cytoplasm. Instead, they have a hollow central space or lumen through which the water passes. The walls of the xylem vessels contain a woody material called lignin (Figure 11.10).

The xylem vessels begin life as living cells with normal cytoplasm and cellulose cell walls. As they develop they become elongated, and gradually their original cellulose cell walls become impregnated with lignin, made by the cytoplasm. As this happens, the cells die, forming hollow tubes. Lignification makes them very strong, and enables them to carry water up tall plants without collapsing. Lignin is also impermeable to water.

Figure 11.10 Xylem vessels in a stem. The spirals and rings (stained red) are made of lignin.

## TRANSPORT IN THE PHLOEM

The other plant transport tissue, the phloem, consists of living cells at all stages in its development. Tubes in the phloem are also formed by cells arranged end-to-end, but they have cell walls made of cellulose, and retain their cytoplasm. The end of each cell is formed by a cross-wall of cellulose with holes, called a sieve plate. The living cytoplasm extends through the holes in the sieve plates, linking each cell with the next, forming a long sieve tube (Figure 11.11). The sieve tubes transport the products of photosynthesis from the leaves to other parts of the plant. Sugars for energy, or amino acids for building proteins, are carried to young leaves and other growing points in the plant. Sugar may also be taken to the roots and converted into starch for storage. Despite being living cells, the phloem sieve tubes have no nucleus. They seem to be controlled by other cells that lie alongside the sieve tubes, called companion cells (Figure 11.11).

Figure 11.11 Xylem vessels in a stem

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Sieve plate | Cross-wall of cellulose with holes |
| Sieve tube | Long tube formed by connected cells |
| Companion cell | Cell controlling sieve tube |
| Cell wall | Made of cellulose |
| Nucleus | Present in companion cell |
| Sieve pores | Holes in sieve plate |

### REMINDER

Remember: xylem carries water and minerals up from the roots. Phloem carries products of photosynthesis away from the leaves. The contents of the phloem can travel up or down the plant.
---

Figure 11.12 (a) This cross-section of a stem shows the arrangement of xylem and phloem tissue in vascular bundles.
(b) Three vascular bundles in part of a stem section. The outer red cells are lignified fibres for extra support.

### KEY POINT
'Vascular' means 'made of vessels'.
A vascular bundle is a group of vessels or tubes (xylem and phloem).

In older stems, the vascular tissue grows to form complete rings around the stem. The inner xylem forms the woody central core of a stem, with the living layer of phloem outside this.
