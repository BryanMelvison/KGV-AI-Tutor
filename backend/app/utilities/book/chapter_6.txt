# 6 COORDINATION

Inthebody 'coordination' means making things happen at the right time by linking up different body activities. Humans and other animals have two organ systems which do this: The first is the nervous system; which is the subject of this chapter: The second is the hormone or endocrine system; which is dealt with in Chapter 7.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

- Understand how organisms are able to respond to changes in their environment.
- Understand that a coordinated response requires a stimulus; a receptor and an effector.
- Understand that the central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord and is linked to sense organs by nerves.
- Describe how the nervous system controls responses out of the central nervous system; resulting in rapid responses.
- Describe the structure and function of the eye as a receptor.
- Understand the function of the eye in focusing on near and distant objects; and in responding to changes in light intensity.
- Describe the structure and functioning of a simple reflex arc, illustrated by the withdrawal of a finger from a hot object.
- Understand the role of neurotransmitters at synapses.

# STIMULUS AND RESPONSE

Suppose you are walking along when you see a football coming at high speed towards your head. If your nerves are working properly, you will probably move or duck quickly to avoid contact. Imagine another situation where you are very...

# KEY POINT

Each of these situations is an example of a stimulus and a response. The surroundings outside the body are called the external environment. A stimulus is a change in an animal's surroundings; and a response is a reaction to that change. In the first example, the approaching ball was the stimulus, your movement to avoid it hitting you was the response.

The inside of the body is known as the internal environment: The body also responds to changes in its internal environment; such as temperature and blood glucose levels: You will read about these responses in Chapters...

The change in your environment was detected by your eyes, which are an example of a receptor organ: The response was brought about by contraction of muscles, which are a type of effector organ (they produce an effect): The nervous system links the two, and is an example of a coordination system:

stimulus
receptor
coordination
effector
response

In the second example, the receptor for the smell of food was the nose, and the response was the secretion of saliva from glands. Glands secrete (release) chemical substances, and they are the second type of effector organ. Again, the link between the stimulus and the response is the nervous system. The information in the nerve cells is transmitted in the form of tiny electrical signals called nerve impulses.

# DID YOU KNOW?

Some animals can detect changes in their environment that are not sensed by humans. Insects such as bees can see ultraviolet (UV) light: The wavelengths of UV are invisible to humans.

Figure 6.1 This yellow flower (a) looks very different to a bee, which sees patterns on the petals reflecting UV light (b).

# RECEPTORS

The role of any receptor is to detect the stimulus by changing its energy into the electrical energy of the nerve impulses. For example; the eye converts light energy into nerve impulses, and the ear converts sound energy into nerve impulses (Table 6.1).

|Receptor|Type of energy received|
|---|---|
|eye (retina)|light|
|ear (organ of hearing)|sound|
|ear (organ of balance)|mechanical (kinetic)|
|tongue (taste buds)|chemical|
|nose (organ of smell)|chemical|
|skin (touch/pressure/pain receptors)|mechanical (kinetic)|
|skin (temperature receptors)|heat|
|muscle (stretch receptors)|mechanical (kinetic)|

Notice how a 'sense' like touch is made up of several components. When we touch a warm surface we will be stimulating several types of receptor; including touch and temperature receptors, as well as stretch receptors in the muscles (see the section on skin in Chapter 8). As well as this, each sense detects different aspects of the energy it receives. For example, the ears don't just detect sounds, but different loudness and frequencies of sound, while the eye not only forms an image, but also detects brightness of light and in humans can tell the difference between different light wavelengths (colours).

Some organisms can even detect the direction of magnetic fields: Many birds; such as pigeons; have a built-in compass in their brain; which they use for navigation. A species of bacterium can also do this; but as yet no one can explain why this might be an advantage to it.

# THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM

The biological name for a nerve cell is a neurone. The impulses that travel along a neurone are not an electric current; as in a wire. They are caused by movements of charged particles (ions) in and out of the neurone. Impulses travel at speeds between about 10 and 100 metres per second, which is much slower than an electric current; but fast enough to produce a rapid response.

Impulses from receptors pass along nerves containing sensory neurones until they reach the brain and spinal cord. These two organs are together known as the central nervous system, or CNS. Other nerves contain motor neurones, transmitting impulses to the muscles and glands. Some nerves contain only sensory or motor cells, while other nerves contain both; they are 'mixed'. A typical nerve contains thousands of individual neurones.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY

# COORDINATION

DID YOU KNOW?

The CNS is well protected by the skeleton: The brain is inside the skull or cranium (nerves connected to the brain are cranial nerves) and the spinal cord runs down the middle of the spinal column; passing through a hole in each vertebra. Nerves connected to the spinal cord are called spinal nerves:

# THE STRUCTURE OF NEURONES

Both sensory and motor neurones can be very long: For example; a motor neurone leading from the CNS to the muscles in the finger has a fibre about a metre in length, which is 100 000 times the length of the cell body (Figure 6.3).

The cell body of a motor neurone is at one end of the fibre; in the CNS The cell body has fine cytoplasmic extensions, called dendrons. These in turn form finer extensions, called dendrites. There can be junctions with other neurones on any part of the cell body, dendrons or dendrites. These junctions are called synapses. Later in this chapter we will deal with the importance of synapses in nerve pathways.

One of the extensions from the motor neurone cell body is much longer than the other dendrons. This is the fibre that carries impulses to the effector organ, and is called the axon. At the end of the axon furthest from the cell body; it divides into many nerve endings: These fine branches of the axon connect with a muscle at a special sort of synapse called a neuromuscular junction. In this way impulses are carried from the CNS out to the muscle. The signals from nerve impulses are transmitted across the neuromuscular junction, causing the muscle fibres to contract.

The axon is covered by a sheath made of a fatty material called myelin: The myelin sheath insulates the axon; preventing 'short circuits' with other axons; and also speeds up the conduction of the impulses. The sheath is formed by the membranes of special cells that wrap themselves around the axon as it develops:

A sensory neurone has a similar structure to the motor neurone; but the cell body is located on a side branch of the fibre, just outside the CNS. The fibre from the sensory receptor to the cell body is actually a dendron; while the fibre from the cell body to the CNS is a short axon. As with motor neurones, fibres of sensory neurones are often myelinated:

# THE EYE

Many animals have eyes, but few show the complexity of the human eye. Simpler animals, such as snails, use their eyes to detect light but cannot form proper images. Other animals, such as dogs, can form images but cannot distinguish colours. The human eye does all three. Of course, it is not really the eye that 'sees' anything at all, but the brain that interprets the impulses from the eye. To find out how light from an object is converted into impulses representing an image, we need to look at the structure of this complex organ (Figure 6.4).

The tough outer coat of the eye is called the sclera, which is the visible white part of the eye. At the front of the eye, the sclera becomes a transparent 'window' called the cornea, which lets light into the eye. Behind the cornea is the coloured ring of tissue called the iris. In the middle of the iris is a hole called the pupil, which lets the light through: It is black because there is no light escaping from the inside of the eye.

|blind spot|optic nerve|

DID YOU KNOW? Underneath the sclera is a dark layer called the choroid. It is dark because it contains many pigment cells, as well as blood vessels. The pigment stops light being reflected around inside the eye.

The fact that the inverted image is seen the right way up by the brain makes the point that it is the brain which 'sees' things, not the eye. An interesting experiment was carried out to test this: Volunteers were made to wear special inverting goggles for long periods. These turned the view of their surroundings upside down. At first this completely disorientated them; and they found it difficult to make even simple coordinated movements. However, after a while their brains adapted, until the view through the goggles looked normal: In fact, when the volunteers removed the goggles; the world then looked upside down!

To form an image on the retina, light needs to be bent or refracted: Refraction takes place when light passes from one medium to another of a different density: In the eye, this happens first at the air/cornea boundary; and again at the lens (Figure 6.5). In fact the cornea acts as the first lens of the eye.

The innermost layer of the back of the eye is the retina: This is the light-sensitive layer; the place where light energy is converted into the electrical energy of nerve impulses. The retina contains receptor cells called rods and cones. These cells react to light; producing impulses in sensory neurones. The sensory neurones then pass the impulses to the brain through the optic nerve. Rod cells work well in dim light; but they cannot distinguish between different colours; so the brain sees an image produced by the rods in black and white. This is why we can't see colours very well in dim light: only our rods are working properly. The cones on the other hand; will only work in bright light, and there are three types which respond to different wavelengths or colours of light: red, green and blue. We can see all the colours of visible light as a result of these three types of cones being stimulated to different degrees. For example, if red, green and blue are stimulated equally, we see white. Both rods and cones are found throughout the retina; but cones are particularly concentrated at the centre of the retina, in an area called the fovea. Cones give a sharper image than rods, which is why we can only see objects clearly if we are looking directly at them, so that the image falls on the fovea.

# COORDINATION

As a result of refraction at the cornea and lens; the image on the retina is inverted (upside down): The brain interprets the image the right way up.

Figure 6.5 How the eye forms an image. Refraction of light occurs at the cornea and lens, producing an inverted image on the retina.

# THE IRIS REFLEX

The role of the iris is to control the amount of light entering the eye, by changing the size of the pupil. The iris contains two types of muscles: Circular muscles form a ring shape in the iris, and radial muscles lie like the spokes of a wheel. In bright light, the pupil is constricted (made smaller): This happens because the circular muscles contract and the radial muscles relax. In dim light, the opposite happens: The radial muscles contract and the circular muscles relax, dilating (widening) the pupil.

Figure 6.6 The amount of light entering the eye is controlled by the iris, which alters the diameter of the pupil.

|---|---|---|
|circular muscles|contract|relax|

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY

# COORDINATION

# KEY POINT

Whenever our eyes look from a dim light to a bright one; the iris rapidly and automatically adjusts the pupil size. This is an example of a reflex action. You will find out more about reflexes later in this chapter: The purpose of the iris reflex is to allow the right intensity (brightness) of light to fall on the retina: Light that is too bright could damage the rods and cones; and light that is too dim would not form an image: The intensity of light hitting the retina is the stimulus for this reflex: Impulses pass to the brain through the optic nerve, and straight back to the iris muscles, adjusting the diameter of the pupil. It all happens without the need for conscious thought in fact we are not even aware of it happening.

# THE BLIND SPOT

There is one area of the retina where an image cannot be formed; this is where the optic nerve leaves the eye. At this position there are no rods or cones, so it is called the blind spot. The retina of each eye has a blind spot; but they are not a problem, because the brain puts the images from each eye together; cancelling out the blind spots of both eyes. As well as this, the optic nerve leaves the eye towards the edge of the retina, where vision is not very sharp anyway: To 'see' your own blind spot you can do a simple experiment: Cover or close your right eye. Hold this page about 30 cm from your eyes and look at the black dot below: Now; without moving the book or turning your head, read the numbers from left to right by moving your left eye slowly towards the right:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15

You should find that when the image of the dot falls on the blind spot it disappears. If you try doing this with both eyes open, the image of the dot will not disappear:

# DID YOU KNOW?

A way to prove to yourself that the eyes form two overlapping images is to try the 'sausage test' Focus your eyes on a distant object: Place your two index fingers tip to tip, and bring 'them up in front of your eyes, about 30 cm from your face, while still focusing at a distance. You should see a finger 'sausage' between the two fingers. Now try this with one eye closed. What is the difference?

# ACCOMMODATION

The changes that take place in the eye which allow us to see objects at different distances are called accommodation. You have probably seen the results of a camera or projector not being in focus a blurred picture: In a camera; we can focus light from objects that are different distances away by moving the lens backward or forward, until the picture is sharp. In the eye, a different method is used. Rather than altering its position, the shape of the lens can be changed: A lens that is fatter in the middle (more convex) will refract light rays more than a thinner (less convex) lens. The lens in the eye can change shape because it is made of cells containing an elastic crystalline protein.

Figure 6.4 shows that the lens is held in place by a series of fibres called the suspensory ligaments. These are attached like the spokes of a wheel to a ring of muscle, called the ciliary muscle. The inside of the eye is filled with

# 84 ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY COORDINATION

transparent watery fluid which pushes outwards on the eye. In other words, there is a slight positive pressure within the eye. The changes to the eye that take place during accommodation are shown in Figure 6.7.

# focusing on a distant object

|lens 'flat'|lens less convex (flatter)|

# focusing on a nearby object

|ciliary muscles contract|suspenory ligaments slack|
|---|---|
|lens more rounded|lens more convex (rounded)|

Figure 6.7 Accommodation: how the eye focuses on objects at different distances

When the eye is focused on a distant object; the rays of light from the object are almost parallel when they reach the cornea (Figure 6.7(a)): The cornea refracts the rays; but the lens does not need to refract them much more to focus the light on the retina, so it does not need to be very convex: The ciliary muscles relax and the pressure in the eye pushes outwards on the lens, flattening it and stretching the suspensory ligaments. This is the condition when the eye is at rest - our eyes are focused for long distances.

When we focus on a nearby object; for example when reading a book; the light rays from the object are spreading out (diverging) when they enter the eye (Figure 6.7(b)). In this situation, the lens has to be more convex in order to refract the rays enough to focus them on the retina. The ciliary muscles now contract; the suspensory ligaments become slack and the elastic lens bulges outwards into a more convex shape.

# REFLEX ACTIONS

|stimulus|receptor|CNS|
|---|---|---|
|sensory neurone|relay neurone|response|
|motor neurone|effector| |

You saw on page 82 that the dilation and constriction of the pupil by the iris is an example of a reflex action. You now need to understand a little more about the nerves involved in a reflex. The nerve pathway of a reflex is called the reflex arc. The 'arc' part means that the pathway goes into the CNS and then straight back out again; in a sort of curve or arc (Figure 6.8).

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY

# COORDINATION

The iris-pupil reflex protects the eye against damage by bright light. Other reflexes are protective too, preventing serious harm to the body. Take, for example, the reflex response to a painful stimulus. This happens when part of your body, such as your hand, touches a sharp or hot object. The reflex results in your hand being quickly withdrawn. Figure 6.9 shows the nerve pathway of this reflex in more detail.

Figure 6.9 A reflex arc in more detail

KEY POINT

The stimulus is detected by temperature or pain receptors in the skin. These generate impulses in sensory neurones. The impulses enter the CNS through a part of the spinal nerve called the dorsal root. In the spinal cord, the sensory neurones connect by synapses with short relay neurones, which in turn connect with motor neurones. The motor neurones emerge from the spinal cord through the ventral root, and send impulses back out to the muscles of the arm. These muscles then contract, pulling the arm (and thus finger) away from the harmful stimulus.

DID YOU KNOW?

The middle part of the spinal cord consists mainly of nerve cell bodies, which gives it a grey colour. This is why it is known as grey matter. The outer part of the spinal cord is called white matter, and has a whiter appearance because it contains many axons with their fatty myelin sheaths. (In the brain this is reversed; the grey matter is on the outside and the white matter in the middle of the brain.)

Impulses travel through the reflex arc in a fraction of a second, so that the reflex action is very fast and doesn't need to be started by impulses from the brain. However, this doesn't mean that the brain is unaware of what is going on. This is because in the spinal cord, the reflex arc neurones also form connections called synapses with nerve cells leading to and from the brain. The brain therefore receives information about the stimulus. This is how we feel the pain.

Movements are sometimes a result of reflex actions, but we can also contract our muscles as a voluntary action, using nerve cell pathways from the brain linked to the same motor neurones. Voluntary action is under conscious control.

# SYNAPSES

Synapses are critical to the working of the nervous system: The CNS is made of many billions of nerve cells, and these have links with many others, through synapses: In the brain; each neurone may form synapses with thousands of other neurones. It is estimated that there are between 100 and 1000 million million synapses in the CNS. Since impulses can take different routes through these, there is an almost infinite number of possible pathways through the system.

A synapse is actually a gap between two nerve cells. The gap is not crossed by the electrical impulses passing through the neurones, but by chemicals. Impulses arriving at a synapse cause the ends of the fine branches of the axon to secrete a chemical, called a neurotransmitter. This chemical diffuses across the gap and attaches to the membrane of the second neurone. It then starts off impulses in the second cell (Figure 6.10). After the neurotransmitter has 'passed on the message', it is broken down by an enzyme.

|synaptic connections with|impulses arrive down axon|neurotransmitter|
|---|---|---|
|other neurones|of first neurone|diffuses across|
| |membrane of|second neurone|
|impulse started in|second neurone|neurotransmitter broken|
|axon| |down by enzyme from|

Figure 6.10 The sequence of events happening at a synapse

Remember that many nerve cells, particularly those in the brain, have thousands of synapses with other neurones. The output of one cell may depend on the inputs from many cells adding together: In this way, synapses are important for integrating information in the CNS (Figure 6.11).

impulses in incoming neurones
impulses in outgoing neurone

Figure 6.11 Synapses allow the output of one nerve cell to be a result of integration of information from many other cells.

Because synapses are crossed by chemicals, it is easy for other chemicals to interfere with the working of the synapse. They may imitate the neurotransmitter; or block its action. This is the way that many drugs work.

# WHAT IS A NERVE IMPULSE?

A nerve impulse is an electrical signal that travels along the axon of a nerve cell. When the cell is not transmitting an impulse, there is a small potential difference (voltage) across the nerve cell membrane. The potential inside the axon is about -70 mV lower than outside. This 'resting potential' is caused by differences in concentrations of various ions inside and outside the cell. When the cell is stimulated, sodium ions (Na+) rush into the axon through the membrane. The inflow of positively charged ions causes the potential to become positive; we say that it is depolarised. This sudden switch in voltage is called an 'action potential'. It only lasts for a few milliseconds (Figure 6.12). After a brief 'overshoot' below -70 mV, it returns to normal (repolarised), as other positive ions (potassium, K+) pass out through the membrane.

# Action potential

|+30|HL|1|0|8|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|-70|g|resting potential| | |
|time / ms| | | | |

Figure 6.12 Nerve cell action potential.

A nerve impulse is a propagated action potential. The action potential stimulates the next part of the cell membrane; so that the depolarisation spreads along the axon. After the action potential has passed, ion exchange pumps in the membrane sort out the imbalance of Na+ and K+ ions. The pumps use ATP for active transport; this is one reason why nerve cells need a lot of metabolic energy from respiration.

Nerve cells are called 'excitable cells' because they can change their membrane potential in this way. Other excitable cells include muscle and receptor cells. If you continue to study biology beyond International GCSE, you will probably learn more about this interesting topic.

A cataract is an eye problem suffered by some people, especially the elderly. The lens of the eye becomes opaque (cloudy) which blocks the passage of light. It can lead to blindness. Cataracts can be treated by a simple eye operation, where a surgeon removes the lens and replaces it with an artificial lens. After the operation, the patient is able to see again, but the eye is unable to carry out accommodation, and the patient will probably need to wear glasses for close-up work, such as reading.
