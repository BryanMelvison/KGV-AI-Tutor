# 10 PLANTS AND FOOD

This chapter looks at photosynthesis, the process by which plants make starch, and the structure of leaves in relation to photosynthesis. It also deals with how plants obtain other nutrients, and their uses in the plant.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

- Investigate photosynthesis by testing for the production of starch in a leaf
- Investigate the need for light, carbon dioxide and chlorophyll for photosynthesis
- Understand the process of photosynthesis and its importance in the conversion of light energy to chemical energy
- Know the word equation and the balanced symbol equation for photosynthesis
- Describe the structure of the leaf and explain how it is adapted for photosynthesis
- Understand how light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration and temperature affect the rate of photosynthesis
- Investigate photosynthesis using the evolution of oxygen from a water plant
- Understand that plants require mineral ions for growth, and that magnesium ions are needed to make chlorophyll and nitrate ions are needed to make amino acids

## PLANTS MAKE STARCH

All the foods shown in Figure 10.1 are products of plants. Some, such as potatoes, rice and bread (made from cereals such as wheat or rye), form the staple diet of humans. They all contain starch, which is the main storage carbohydrate made by plants. Starch is a good way of storing carbohydrate because it insoluble, compact and can be broken down easily.

Figure 10.1 All these foods are made by plants or made from products of plants. They all contain starch.

## ACTIVITY 1

### PRACTICAL: TESTING LEAVES FOR STARCH

You can test for starch in food by adding a few drops of yellow-brown iodine solution (see Chapter 4). If the food contains starch, a blue-black colour is produced.

Leaves that have been in sunlight also contain starch, but you can't test for it by adding iodine solution to a fresh leaf. The outer waxy surface of the leaf will not absorb the solution, and besides, the green colour of the leaf would hide the colour change. To test for starch in a leaf, the outer waxy layer needs to be removed and the leaf decolourised. This is done by placing the leaf in boiling ethanol (see Figure 10.2).

A beaker of water is set up on a tripod and gauze and the water heated until it boils. A leaf is removed from a plant and killed by placing it in boiling water for 30 seconds (this stops all chemical reactions in the leaf).

The Bunsen burner is turned off (this is important because ethanol is highly flammable), the leaf is placed in a boiling tube containing ethanol, and the tube is placed in the beaker of hot water. The boiling point of ethanol (about 78°C) is lower than that of water (100°C) so the ethanol will boil for a few minutes, until the water cools down. This is long enough to remove most of the chlorophyll from the leaf.

When the leaf has turned colourless or pale yellow, it is removed and washed in cold water to soften it, then spread out on a tile and covered with a few drops of iodine solution. After a few minutes, any parts of the leaf that contain starch will turn a dark blue-black colour. This only works if the plant has had plenty of light for some hours before the test.

#### Figure 10.2 How to test a leaf for starch

1. Remove leaf from potted plant
2. Dewax in boiling water (30 seconds)
3. Remove colour in boiling ethanol
4. Turn off Bunsen burner
5. Wash with cold water
6. Add iodine solution

> **Safety note:** Wash your hands after handling the leaves. Take care not to splash boiling water. Do not heat the ethanol directly with any flame: instead use a beaker of hot water. Iodine solution will badly stain everything - including skin.

## KEY POINT

You can 'de-starch' a plant by placing it in the dark for 2 or 3 days. The plant uses up the starch stores in its leaves. De-starched plants are used to find out the conditions needed for the plant to make more starch by photosynthesis.

Starch is only made in the parts of plants that contain chlorophyll. You can show this by testing a leaf from a variegated plant, which has green and white areas to its leaves. The white parts of the leaf will give a negative starch test, staining yellow-brown with iodine solution. Only the green areas will stain blue-black. Figure 10.3 shows the results of a starch test on a leaf. The leaf was taken from a plant that had been under a bright light for 24 hours.

![Figure 10.3 Testing a leaf for starch: (a) Leaf before test (b) Decolourised leaf (c) Leaf after test, stained blue-black with iodine solution.]

## HINT

You might think that the results of the test on the variegated leaf prove that chlorophyll is needed for photosynthesis. But is this conclusion fully justified? The leaf could have photosynthesised in the white areas and the sugars been transported elsewhere in the plant. Similarly, the green areas may not be photosynthesising at all, but simply laying down starch from glucose made somewhere else. All it really shows is that starch is present in the green areas and not in the white areas of the leaf. We assume this is because chlorophyll is needed for photosynthesis.

![Figure 10.4 Demonstration that carbon dioxide is needed for photosynthesis. The soda lime absorbs carbon dioxide from the air in the bell jar. A Control experiment should be set up, using exactly the same apparatus but without the soda lime.]

Taking away the source of light is not the only way you can prevent a plant making starch in its leaves. You can also place it in a closed container containing a chemical called soda lime (Figure 10.4). This substance absorbs carbon dioxide from the air around the plant. If the plant is kept under a bright light but with no carbon dioxide, it again won't be able to make starch.

## WHERE DOES THE STARCH COME FROM?

You have now found out three important facts about starch production by leaves:

- it uses carbon dioxide from the air
- it needs light
- it needs chlorophyll in the leaves.

As well as starch, there is another product of this process which is essential to the existence of most living things on the Earth – oxygen. When a plant is in the light, it makes oxygen gas. You can show this using an aquatic plant such as Elodea (Canadian pondweed). When a piece of this plant is placed in a test tube of water under a bright light, it produces a stream of small bubbles. If the bubbles are collected and their contents analysed, they are found to contain a high concentration of oxygen (Figure 10.5).

                                              Figure 10.5 The bubbles of gas released from this pondweed contain a higher concentration of
                                              oxygen than in atmospheric air:
                                           Starch is composed of long chains of glucose (see Chapter 4). A plant does
                                           not make starch directly, but first produces glucose, which is then joined
                                           together in chains to form starch molecules_ carbohydrate made of many
                                           sugar sub-units is called a polysaccharide. Glucose has the formula CgH,2Os:
                                           The carbon and oxygen atoms of the glucose molecule come from the carbon
                                           dioxide gas in the air around the plant: The hydrogen atoms come from
                                           another molecule essential to the living plant water:
                                           It would be very difficult in a school laboratory to show that a plant uses
                                           water to make starch: If you deprived a plant of water in the same way as yoU
                                           deprived it of carbon dioxide, it would soon wilt and eventually die. However;
                                           scientists have proved that water is used in photosynthesis_ Theyhave done
                                           this by supplying the plant with water with 'labelled' atoms, for example using
                                           the 'heavy' isotope of oxygen (180. This isotope ends up in the oxygen gas

                                        The role of the green pigment; chlorophyll; is to absorb the light energy
                                        needed for the reaction to take place. The products of the reaction (glucose
                                        and oxygen) contain more energy than the carbon dioxide and water: In other
                                        words, photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy:
                                        You will probably have noticed that the overall equation for photosynthesis is
                                        the reverse of the one for aerobic respiration (see Chapter 1):
                                              C6H12O6 + 602       6CO2 + 6H20 (plus energy)
                                        Respiration; which is carried out by both animals and plants, releases energy
                                        (but not as light) from the breakdown of glucose. The chemical energy in the
                                        glucose came originally from light 'trapped' by the process of photosynthesis_

 THE STRUCTURE OF LEAVES                Most green parts of a plant can photosynthesise, but the leaves are the plant
                                        organs which are best adapted for this function: To be able to photosynthesise
                                                                  efficiently, leaves need to have a large surface area to absorb light; many
                                        chloroplasts containing the chlorophyll; a supply of water and carbon dioxide,
                                        and asystem for carrying away the products of photosynthesis to other parts

                                        leaf cells. Most leaves are thin, flat structures supported by a leaf stalk which
                                        can grow to allow the blade of the leaf to be angled to receive the maximum
                                        amount of sunlight (Figure 10.6).

---
Inside the leaf are layers of cells with different functions.

- The two outer layers of cells (the upper and lower epidermis) have few chloroplasts and are covered by a thin layer of a waxy material called the cuticle. This reduces water loss by evaporation, and acts as a barrier to the entry of disease-causing microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi.

- The lower epidermis has many holes or pores called stomata (a single pore is a stoma). Usually the upper epidermis contains fewer or no stomata. The stomata allow carbon dioxide to diffuse into the leaf, to reach the photosynthetic tissues. They also allow oxygen and water vapour to diffuse out. Each stoma is formed as a gap between two highly specialised cells called guard cells, which can change their shape to open or close the stoma.

- In the middle of the leaf are two layers of photosynthetic cells called the mesophyll ("mesophyll" just means "middle of the leaf"). Just below the upper epidermis is the palisade mesophyll layer. This is a tissue made of long, narrow cells, each containing hundreds of chloroplasts, and is the main site of photosynthesis. The palisade cells are close to the source of light, and the upper epidermis is relatively transparent, allowing light to pass through to the enormous numbers of chloroplasts which lie below.

- Below the palisade layer is a tissue made of more rounded, loosely packed cells, with air spaces between them, called the spongy mesophyll layer. These cells also photosynthesise, but have fewer chloroplasts than the palisade cells. They form the main gas exchange surface of the leaf, absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen and water vapour. The air spaces allow these gases to diffuse in and out of the mesophyll.

- Water and mineral ions are supplied to the leaf by vessels in a tissue called the xylem. This forms a continuous transport system throughout the plant. Water is absorbed by the roots and passes up through the stem and through veins in the leaves in the transpiration stream. In the leaves, the water leaves the xylem and supplies the mesophyll cells.

- The products of photosynthesis, such as sugars, are carried away from the mesophyll cells by another transport system, the phloem. The phloem supplies all other parts of the plant, so that tissues and organs that can't make their own food receive products of photosynthesis. The veins in the leaf contain both xylem and phloem tissue, and branch again and again to supply all parts of the leaf.

You will find out more about both plant transport systems in Chapter 11.

### KEY POINT

Starch is insoluble and so cannot be transported around the plant. The phloem carries only soluble substances such as sugars (mainly sucrose) and amino acids. These are converted into other compounds when they reach their destination.

## FACTORS AFFECTING THE RATE OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS

When the light intensity rises, the rate of photosynthesis begins by rising too, but eventually it reaches a maximum rate. What makes the rate 'level off' (flatten) like this? It is because some other factor needed for photosynthesis is in short supply, so that increasing the light intensity does not affect the rate any more. Normally, the factor which 'holds back' the rate of photosynthesis is the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air. This is only about 0.03 to 0.04%, and the plant can only take up the carbon dioxide and fix it into carbohydrate at a certain rate. If the plant is put in a closed container with a higher than normal concentration of carbon dioxide, it will photosynthesise at a faster rate. If there is both a high light intensity and a high level of carbon dioxide, the temperature may limit the rate of photosynthesis, by limiting the rate of the chemical reactions in the leaf. A rise in temperature will then increase the rate. With normal levels of carbon dioxide, very low temperatures (close to 0 °C) slow the reactions, but high temperatures (above about 35 °C) also reduce photosynthesis by denaturing enzymes in the plant cells (see Chapter 1).

### KEY POINT

A limiting factor is the component of a reaction that is in 'shortest supply' so that it prevents the rate of the reaction increasing; in other words sets a 'limit' to it.

## KEY POINT

Knowledge of limiting factors is used in some glasshouses (greenhouses) to speed up the growth of crop plants such as tomatoes and lettuces (see Chapter 15). Extra carbon dioxide is added to the air around the plants, by using gas burners. The higher concentration of carbon dioxide, along with the high temperature in the glasshouse, increases the rate of photosynthesis and the growth of the leaves and fruits.

Light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration and temperature can all act as what are called limiting factors in this way. This is easier to see as a graph (Figure 10.7).

| Condition | CO2 Concentration | Temperature |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| High      | 0.15% CO2         | 30°C        |
| Medium    | 0.15% CO2         | 20°C        |
| Low       | 0.03% CO2         | 20°C or 30°C|

Figure 10.7 Light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration and temperature can all act as limiting factors on the rate of photosynthesis.

## ACTIVITY 2

### PRACTICAL: MEASURING THE RATE OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS USING PONDWEED

> Safety note: Wash hands after collecting and preparing pondweed. Do not handle the lamp, plug or switch with wet hands.

You can measure the rate of photosynthesis of a plant by measuring how quickly it produces oxygen. With a land plant this is difficult, because the oxygen is released into the air, but with an aquatic plant such as the pondweed Elodea, bubbles of oxygen are released into the water around the plant (Figure 10.5).

If the bubbles formed per minute are counted, this is a measure of the rate of photosynthesis of the plant. It is easiest to count the bubbles if the cut piece of weed is placed upside down in a test tube, as shown in Figure 10.8. A small paperclip attached to the bottom of the piece of weed makes it sink.

Figure 10.8 Measuring the rate of photosynthesis in an aquatic plant.

The light intensity is changed by moving the lamp, altering the distance between the lamp and the pondweed. The beaker of water keeps the temperature of the plant constant.

                                                     photosynthesis? What factors would you need to keep constant this

              THE PLANT'S USES FOR GLUCOSE         As you have seen, some glucose that the plant makes is used in respiration to
                                                   provide the plant's cells with energy: Some glucose is quickly converted into
                                                   starch for storage. However; a plant is not made up of just glucose and starch

                  (aalso used
                for respiration)                   Glucose is a single sugar unit (a monosaccharide) Plant cells can convert it

                                                    Glucose from photosynthesis is not just used as the raw material for the production
                                                    of molecules such as starch, cellulose, lipids and proteins. Reactions like these,
                                                    which synthesise large molecules from smaller ones, also need a source of energy:
                                                   This energy is provided by the plant's respiration of glucose.

                                      is needed for the plant cells to make many important compounds;
                                      including DNA. Potassium ions are required for enzymes in respiration and
                                      photosynthesis to work, and magnesium forms a part of the chlorophyll

WATER CULTURE EXPERIMENTS              A plant takes only water and mineral ions from the soil for growth Plants can
                                      be grown in soil-free cultures (water cultures) if the correct balance of minerals
                                      is added to the water: In the nineteenth century, the German biologist Wilhelm
                                      Knop invented one example of a culture solution: Knop's solution contains the
                                      following chemicals (per dm? of water):
                                            0.8g      calcium nitrate
                                            0.2g      magnesium sulfate
                                            0.2g      potassium nitrate
                                            0.2g      potassium dihydrogenphosphate

symptoms in the plant, called a mineral deficiency disease. For example, lack of magnesium means that the plant won't be able to make chlorophyll, and the leaves will turn yellow. Lack of nitrate limits a plant's growth, because it is unable to make enough protein. Some of the mineral ions that a plant needs, their uses, and the deficiency symptoms are shown in Table 10.1. Compare the photographs of the mineral deficient plants to those of the control plant in Figure 10.11(a).

Table 10.1: Mineral ions needed by plants

| Mineral ion | Use | Deficiency symptoms |
|-------------|-----|---------------------|
| nitrate | making amino acids, proteins, chlorophyll, DNA and many other compounds | limited growth of plant; older leaves turn yellow |
| phosphate | making DNA and many other compounds; part of cell membranes | poor root growth; younger leaves turn purple |
| potassium | needed for enzymes of respiration and photosynthesis to work | leaves turn yellow with dead spots |
| magnesium | part of chlorophyll molecule | leaves turn yellow |

 DID YOU KNOW?
 Some commercial crops such as
 lettuces can be grown without
 soil in culture solutions. This is
 called hydroponics: The plants'
 roots grow in a long plastic tube
 that has culture solution passing
 through it (Figure 10.12). The
 composition of the solution can
 be carefully adjusted to ensure
 the plants grow well. Pests such
 as insects, which might live in
 soil, are also less of a problem.       Figure 10.12 Lettuce plants grown by hydroponics

                                         LOOKING AHEAD         MORE ABOUT PHOTOSYNTHESIS
                                          The role of chlorophyll is to absorb the light energy needed to drive
                                          photosynthesis The products of the reaction (glucose and oxygen)
                                          contain more chemical energy than the reactants (carbon dioxide and
                                          water). The simple equation for photosynthesis that you saw earlier in this
                                          chapter is actually a summary of a series of reactions_ Theytake place in
                                         two stages (Figure 10.13).

                                            independent reactions.
                                          The light energy absorbed by the chlorophyll is used to split water
                                          molecules into hydrogen and oxygen: The waste product; oxygen; is
                                          given off as a gas At the same time, the light energy is used to convert
                                          ADP and phosphate into ATP Because this stage needs light; the steps in
                                          the process are known as the light-dependent reactions_
                                          Next; the hydrogen atoms from the water and energy from the ATP are
                                          used to reduce carbon dioxide to glucose. This takes place in another
                                          series of reactions in the chloroplast: Because these do not need light;
                                         they are called the light-independent reactions_
                                          If you continue with biology beyond International GCSE, you will find out

### SKILLS > REASONING

b. Using your graph, predict the number of bubbles per minute that would be produced if the lamp was placed 17cm from the weed.

c. The student who carried out this experiment arrived at the following conclusion:
   "The gas made by the weed is oxygen from photosynthesis, so the faster production of bubbles shows that the rate of photosynthesis is greater at higher light intensities."

   Write down three reasons why his conclusion could be criticised.
   (Hint: is counting the bubbles a reliable method of measuring the rate of photosynthesis?)

### SKILLS > INTERPRETATION

9. Write a summary account of photosynthesis. You should include a description of the process, a summary equation, an account of how a leaf is adapted for photosynthesis and a note of how photosynthesis is important to other organisms, such as animals. You must keep your summary to less than two sides (about 500 words).
