# CHAPTER 7: CHEMICAL COORDINATION

## INTRODUCTION TO CHEMICAL COORDINATION

THE BODY'S COORDINATION SYSTEMS INCLUDE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM. THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, DISCUSSED IN CHAPTER 6, CONNECTS STIMULI TO RESPONSES THROUGH NERVE SIGNALS. IN CONTRAST, THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM FUNCTIONS DIFFERENTLY BY USING CHEMICAL MESSENGERS CALLED HORMONES PRODUCED BY ENDOCRINE GLANDS. THESE HORMONES ARE RELEASED INTO THE BLOODSTREAM AND INFLUENCE VARIOUS BODY PROCESSES.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

BY THE END OF THIS CHAPTER, READERS WILL BE ABLE TO:
- EXPLAIN HOW HORMONAL COMMUNICATION REGULATES RESPONSES.
- DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN NERVOUS AND HORMONAL CONTROL MECHANISMS.
- IDENTIFY THE SOURCES, ROLES, AND EFFECTS OF KEY HORMONES: ADRENALINE, INSULIN, TESTOSTERONE, PROGESTERONE, AND OESTROGEN. THESE HORMONES ARE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL LATER.

## GLANDS AND HORMONES

### TYPES OF GLANDS

GLANDS ARE ORGANS THAT SECRETE SUBSTANCES. THERE ARE TWO MAIN TYPES:

1. **EXOCRINE GLANDS**: THESE GLANDS RELEASE PRODUCTS THROUGH DUCTS. EXAMPLES INCLUDE:
   - SALIVARY GLANDS, WHICH PRODUCE SALIVA FOR THE MOUTH.
   - TEAR GLANDS, WHICH SECRETE TEARS NEAR THE EYE.

2. **ENDOCRINE GLANDS**: THESE GLANDS LACK DUCTS AND RELEASE HORMONES DIRECTLY INTO THE BLOODSTREAM. THESE HORMONES THEN TARGET SPECIFIC TISSUES TO PERFORM THEIR FUNCTIONS.

### GLAND FUNCTION

ENDOCRINE GLANDS PRODUCE HORMONES THAT ACT AS CHEMICAL MESSENGERS, TRAVELING THROUGH THE BLOODSTREAM TO INFLUENCE DISTANT TISSUES. THIS METHOD OF COMMUNICATION ALLOWS FOR COORDINATED RESPONSES ACROSS THE BODY.

## HORMONAL EFFECTS

HORMONES ARE POTENT CHEMICAL SIGNALS THAT CAN AFFECT VARIOUS TISSUES AND ORGANS. DESPITE CIRCULATING THROUGHOUT THE BLOODSTREAM, THEY TYPICALLY TARGET SPECIFIC TISSUES KNOWN AS TARGET TISSUES TO INDUCE RESPONSES. UNDERSTANDING THESE HORMONES AND THEIR ROLES IS ESSENTIAL FOR GRASPING CHEMICAL COORDINATION IN ORGANISMS.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: CHEMICAL COORDINATION

## KEY POINTS
HORMONES ARE CHEMICAL MESSENGERS PRODUCED BY GLANDS IN THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM. THESE HORMONES ARE RECOGNIZED BY SPECIFIC RECEPTORS ON TARGET CELLS, WHICH VARY IN LOCATION—SOME ARE FOUND ON THE CELL MEMBRANE, OTHERS IN THE CYTOPLASM OR NUCLEUS. WITHOUT THESE RECEPTORS, A CELL CANNOT RESPOND TO THE HORMONE.

## DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NERVOUS AND ENDOCRINE CONTROL
THE NERVOUS SYSTEM COMMUNICATES THROUGH NERVE IMPULSES VIA NERVE CELLS, ACTING ALMOST INSTANTLY AND TYPICALLY PRODUCING SHORT-LIVED RESPONSES. IN CONTRAST, THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM USES HORMONES TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE BLOODSTREAM, LEADING TO SLOWER BUT LONGER-LASTING EFFECTS. WHILE NERVE IMPULSES OFTEN TARGET INDIVIDUAL CELLS, SUCH AS MUSCLE FIBERS, HORMONES CAN INFLUENCE MULTIPLE ORGANS BUT ONLY AFFECT THOSE WITH THE APPROPRIATE RECEPTORS.

## THE ENDOCRINE GLANDS
THE MAIN ENDOCRINE GLANDS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW. THE PITUITARY GLAND PRODUCES VARIOUS HORMONES THAT REGULATE BODY PROCESSES AND CONTROL OTHER GLANDS. THE THYROID GLAND RELEASES THYROXINE, WHICH GOVERNS METABOLIC RATES IN CELLS. THE PANCREAS SECRETES INSULIN TO LOWER BLOOD GLUCOSE AND GLUCAGON TO RAISE IT. ADRENAL GLANDS PRODUCE ADRENALINE, PREPARING THE BODY FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. IN WOMEN, THE OVARIES RELEASE ESTROGEN, INFLUENCING FEMALE SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERISTICS, WHILE PROGESTERONE REGULATES THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE. SIMILARLY, MEN'S TESTES SECRETE TESTOSTERONE, AFFECTING MALE SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERISTICS.

UNDERSTANDING THESE HORMONES AND GLANDS IS ESSENTIAL FOR GRASPING HOW THE BODY MAINTAINS HOMEOSTASIS AND RESPONDS TO VARIOUS STIMULI.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: CHEMICAL COORDINATION

## THE PANCREAS: A DUAL FUNCTION GLAND

THE PANCREAS FUNCTIONS AS BOTH AN ENDOCRINE AND EXOCRINE GLAND. IT REGULATES BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS BY SECRETING HORMONES AND AIDS THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM BY RELEASING ENZYMES THROUGH PANCREATIC DUCTS INTO THE SMALL INTESTINE.

### ENDOCRINE FUNCTIONS OF SEX ORGANS

SEX ORGANS, INCLUDING TESTES IN MALES AND OVARIES IN FEMALES, PRODUCE HORMONES ESSENTIAL FOR REPRODUCTION BEYOND THEIR ROLE IN PRODUCING SEX CELLS.

## ADRENALINE: THE 'FIGHT OR FLIGHT' HORMONE

### THE ROLE OF ADRENALINE
ADRENALINE, PRODUCED BY ADRENAL GLANDS LOCATED NEAR THE KIDNEYS, PREPARES THE BODY FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION. IN ANIMALS, THIS RESPONSE IS OFTEN A FIGHT-OR-FLIGHT REACTION. IN HUMANS, IT CAN OCCUR IN VARIOUS STRESS SITUATIONS.

### EFFECTS OF ADRENALINE ON THE BODY
WHEN ADRENALINE IS RELEASED:
- **INCREASED BREATHING RATE**: DEEPENS TO ENHANCE OXYGEN INTAKE.
- **FASTER HEART RATE**: BOOSTS BLOOD FLOW TO MUSCLES.
- **BLOOD REDISTRIBUTION**: SHIFTING FROM INTESTINES TO MUSCLES.
- **GLUCOSE RELEASE**: CONVERTS STORED CARBOHYDRATES INTO GLUCOSE FOR ENERGY.
- **PUPIL DILATION**: ENHANCES VISUAL SENSITIVITY.
- **HAIR ERECTION**: MAKES THE BODY APPEAR LARGER.
- **INCREASED MENTAL AWARENESS**: SHARPENS REACTION TIMES.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: CHEMICAL COORDINATION

## ADRENALINE AND STRESSFUL SITUATIONS
IN HUMANS, ADRENALINE IS RELEASED NOT ONLY DURING 'FIGHT OR FLIGHT' SITUATIONS BUT ALSO IN VARIOUS STRESSFUL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS PREPARING FOR A RACE, GOING FOR A JOB INTERVIEW, OR TAKING AN EXAM.

## INSULIN AND BLOOD GLUCOSE CONTROL
ADRENALINE RAISES BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS BY MOBILIZING GLUCOSE FROM STORES IN THE LIVER. THE LIVER CELLS STORE CARBOHYDRATES IN THE FORM OF GLYCOGEN, WHICH IS COMPOSED OF LONG CHAINS OF GLUCOSE SUB-UNITS. GLYCOGEN IS A LARGE, INSOLUBLE MOLECULE, MAKING IT AN EFFECTIVE STORAGE PRODUCT. WHEN THE BODY REQUIRES GLUCOSE, GLYCOGEN CAN BE BROKEN DOWN INTO GLUCOSE, WHICH THEN ENTERS THE BLOODSTREAM.

WHILE ADRENALINE INCREASES BLOOD GLUCOSE CONCENTRATION IN EMERGENCIES, OTHER HORMONES MAINTAIN A FAIRLY CONSTANT GLUCOSE LEVEL IN THE BLOOD, TYPICALLY A LITTLE LESS THAN 1 G OF GLUCOSE PER CUBIC DECIMETRE (DM³) OF BLOOD. THE PRIMARY HORMONE RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTROLLING BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS IS INSULIN, PRODUCED BY SPECIAL CELLS IN THE PANCREAS. INSULIN STIMULATES LIVER CELLS TO ABSORB GLUCOSE AND CONVERT IT INTO GLYCOGEN, THEREBY LOWERING BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS.

### DID YOU KNOW?
THE CONCENTRATION OF GLUCOSE IN YOUR BLOOD BEGINS TO RISE AFTER A MEAL. SUGARS FROM DIGESTED CARBOHYDRATES ARE ABSORBED INTO THE BLOODSTREAM AND TRANSPORTED TO THE LIVER VIA THE HEPATIC PORTAL VEIN. IN THE LIVER, GLUCOSE IS CONVERTED TO GLYCOGEN, RESULTING IN A LOWER CONCENTRATION OF GLUCOSE IN THE BLOOD LEAVING THE LIVER THROUGH THE HEPATIC VEIN.

## DIABETES
SOME INDIVIDUALS SUFFER FROM DIABETES, A CONDITION WHERE THE PANCREAS CANNOT PRODUCE ENOUGH INSULIN TO MAINTAIN NORMAL BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS, LEADING TO DANGEROUSLY HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF GLUCOSE IN THE BLOOD. A COMMON SYMPTOM OF DIABETES CAN BE DETECTED THROUGH A CHEMICAL TEST ON URINE; NORMALLY, THERE IS NO GLUCOSE PRESENT IN URINE, BUT INDIVIDUALS WITH DIABETES MAY EXCRETE GLUCOSE DUE TO HIGH BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS. THIS CAN BE TESTED USING COLORED TEST STRIPS (SEE FIGURE 7.5).

### KEY POINT
DIABETES IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS 'TYPE 1' DIABETES, BUT THERE IS ALSO 'TYPE 2' DIABETES. IN TYPE 2 DIABETES, THE PANCREAS PRODUCES INSULIN, BUT THE BODY BECOMES RESISTANT TO ITS EFFECTS. INITIALLY, THE PANCREAS COMPENSATES BY PRODUCING EXTRA INSULIN, BUT OVER TIME IT MAY FAIL TO PRODUCE ENOUGH TO KEEP BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS NORMAL. TYPE 2 DIABETES IS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH BEING OVERWEIGHT AND HAVING A POOR DIET HIGH IN SUGAR AND CARBOHYDRATES. IT CAN BE PREVENTED AND MANAGED THROUGH A HEALTHY DIET AND REGULAR EXERCISE. TYPE 2 DIABETES TYPICALLY OCCURS IN MIDDLE-AGED OR OLDER INDIVIDUALS, WHILE TYPE 1 DIABETES CAN DEVELOP AT ANY AGE, OFTEN IN CHILDHOOD.

ANOTHER SYMPTOM OF DIABETES IS CONSTANT THIRST, WHICH OCCURS BECAUSE HIGH BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS STIMULATE RECEPTORS IN THE HYPOTHALAMUS OF THE BRAIN, ACTIVATING THIRST CENTERS. THIS PROMPTS INDIVIDUALS TO DRINK MORE FLUIDS TO DILUTE THEIR BLOOD.

SEVERE DIABETES CAN BE LIFE-THREATENING. IF LEFT UNTREATED, IT CAN LEAD TO WEIGHT LOSS, WEAKNESS, AND EVENTUALLY COMA OR DEATH.

TO MANAGE BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS, INDIVIDUALS WITH DIABETES SHOULD LIMIT THEIR INTAKE OF CARBOHYDRATES, SUCH AS STARCHES AND SUGARS, WHICH ARE THE PRIMARY SOURCES OF GLUCOSE IN THE BLOOD.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY

## KEY POINT
INSULIN IS A HORMONE THAT REGULATES BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS BY FACILITATING THE STORAGE OF GLUCOSE AS GLYCOGEN IN LIVER CELLS AND PROMOTING ITS UTILIZATION FOR ENERGY. SINCE INSULIN IS RAPIDLY BROKEN DOWN BY PROTEASE ENZYMES IN THE GUT WHEN TAKEN ORALLY, IT MUST BE ADMINISTERED VIA MUSCLE INJECTION TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE ABSORPTION.

## DID YOU KNOW
INSULIN HAS BEEN USED TO TREAT DIABETES SINCE 1921, SAVING MILLIONS OF LIVES. INITIALLY EXTRACTED FROM ANIMAL PANCREASES, MUCH OF TODAY'S INSULIN STILL COMES FROM THIS METHOD. HOWEVER, SINCE THE 1970S, HUMAN INSULIN HAS BEEN PRODUCED USING GENETICALLY MODIFIED BACTERIA, WHICH ARE ENGINEERED TO PRODUCE THE INSULIN GENE (SEE CHAPTER 21).

## CHEMICAL COORDINATION
INDIVIDUALS WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES MUST INJECT INSULIN DAILY TO REGULATE THEIR BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS. THEY CAN MONITOR THEIR GLUCOSE USING A SENSOR THAT MEASURES BLOOD GLUCOSE THROUGH FINGER PRICKING. THE SENSOR PROVIDES ACCURATE READINGS, HELPING THEM DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE INSULIN DOSAGE (SEE FIGURE 7.6).

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: CHEMICAL COORDINATION

## UNDERSTANDING DIABETES
DIABETES IS A CONDITION WHERE THE BODY STRUGGLES TO REGULATE BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS. UNCONTROLLED GLUCOSE CAN LEAD TO SERIOUS HEALTH ISSUES.

### SYMPTOMS OF DIABETES
THE FOLLOWING ARE SYMPTOMS OF TYPE 1 DIABETES:
- HIGH INSULIN LEVELS IN THE BLOOD
- LOW GLUCOSE LEVELS IN THE BLOOD
- GLUCOSE FOUND IN THE URINE
- INSULIN PRESENT IN THE URINE

### CRITICAL THINKING
WHY IS UNCONTROLLED BLOOD GLUCOSE DANGEROUS?

### MONITORING BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS
TWO METHODS TO MONITOR BLOOD GLUCOSE INCLUDE:
1. USING A BLOOD GLUCOSE METER TO MEASURE LEVELS THROUGH A FINGER PRICK.
2. CHECKING GLUCOSE LEVELS VIA A CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITOR, WHICH PROVIDES REAL-TIME DATA.

### CONTROLLING BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS
TWO STRATEGIES TO MANAGE BLOOD GLUCOSE ARE:
1. ADHERING TO A BALANCED DIET RICH IN FRUITS, VEGETABLES, AND WHOLE GRAINS.
2. REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO HELP THE BODY USE INSULIN MORE EFFECTIVELY.

## HORMONES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS
HORMONES ARE PRODUCED BY ENDOCRINE GLANDS. HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES:
- **HORMONE A**: STIMULATES THE LIVER TO CONVERT GLUCOSE INTO GLYCOGEN FOR ENERGY STORAGE.
- **HORMONE B**: INITIATES THE 'FIGHT OR FLIGHT' RESPONSE, INCREASING HEART RATE AND ALERTNESS.
- **HORMONE C**: REGULATES VOICE BREAKING IN MALES DURING PUBERTY.
- **HORMONE D**: FACILITATES UTERINE LINING DEVELOPMENT DURING THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE.

## BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS OVER TIME
A GRAPH ILLUSTRATES BLOOD GLUCOSE CHANGES OVER 12 HOURS IN A HEALTHY WOMAN. PEAKS OCCUR AFTER MEALS, WHILE TROUGHS INDICATE LOW GLUCOSE LEVELS.

### EXPLANATION OF GRAPH
- **POINT X**: A RISE IN BLOOD GLUCOSE LIKELY FOLLOWS MEAL CONSUMPTION.
- **POINT Y**: THE BODY DECREASES GLUCOSE THROUGH INSULIN, WHICH SIGNALS THE LIVER TO CONVERT GLYCOGEN INTO GLUCOSE FOR STORAGE.

THIS UNDERSTANDING IS CRUCIAL FOR MANAGING CONDITIONS LIKE DIABETES, EMPHASIZING THE ROLE OF HORMONES AND LIFESTYLE IN MAINTAINING HEALTH.
