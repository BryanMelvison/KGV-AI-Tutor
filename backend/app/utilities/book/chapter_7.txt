 7 CHEMICAL COORDINATION

The nervous system (Chapter 6) is a coordination system forming a link between stimulus and response: The body
has a second coordination system; which does not involve nerves. This is the endocrine system. It consists of organs
called endocrine glands, which make chemical messenger substances called hormones. Hormones are carried in the
bloodstream_

                                         GLANDS AND HORMONES
                                         gland is an organ that releases or secretes a substance. This means that
                                      cells in the gland make a chemical which leaves the cells through the cell
                                      membrane. The chemical then travels somewhere else in the body, where it
                                      carries out its function There are two types of glands exocrine and endocrine
                                      glands. Exocrine glands secrete their products through a tube called a duct
                                      For example, salivary glands in your mouth secrete saliva down salivary ducts
                                      and tear glands secrete tears through ducts that lead to the surface of the eye_
                                      Endocrine glands have no duct; and so are called ductless glands. Instead,
                                      their products, the hormones are secreted into the blood vessels that pass
                                      through the gland (Figure 7.1).

                                        The pancreas is both an endocrine and an exocrine gland. It secretes two
                                        hormones involved in the regulation of blood glucose, and is also a gland of
                                        the digestive system, secreting enzymes through the pancreatic duct into the
                                        small intestine (see Chapter 4) The sex organs of males (testes) and females
                                        (ovaries) are also endocrine organs. In addition to their role in producing sex
                                        cells, the testes and ovaries make hormones that are involved in controlling
                                       reproduction. This topic is covered more fully in Chapter 9. We will now look at
                                        the functions of two hormones in more detail.

                                          ADRENALINE        THE 'FIGHT OR FLIGHT' HORMONE
 DID YOU KNOW?                          When you are frightened, excited or angry, your adrenal glands secrete the

 the adrenal glands are located         for action. In animals other than humans this action usually means dealing
   ontopof these organs (see            with an attack by an enemy, where the animal can stay and fight or run away
 Figure 7.2).                             hence 'fight or flight'. This is not often a problem with humans, but there are

                                        If an animal's body is going to be prepared for action, the muscles need a
                                             supply of oxygen and glucose for respiration. Adrenaline produces
                                        good
                                        several changes in the body that make this happen (Figure 7.4) as well as other
                                        changes to prepare for fight or flight:
                                          The breathing rate increases and breaths become deeper; taking more
                                          oxygen into the body:
                                          The heart beats faster; sending more blood to the muscles, so that they
                                          receive more glucose and oxygen for respiration_
                                          Blood is diverted away from the intestine and into the muscles_
                                          In the liver; stored carbohydrate (glycogen) is changed into glucose and
                                          released into the blood. The muscle cells absorb more glucose and use it
                                          for respiration:
                                          The pupils dilate, increasing visual sensitivity to movement:

                                             In humans, adrenaline is not just released in a 'fight or flight' situation; but in
                                             many other stressful activities too, such as preparing for a race, going for a job

                                             You saw earlier that adrenaline can raise blood glucose from stores in the
                                             liver: The liver cells contain carbohydrate in the form of glycogen. Glycogen
                                             is made from long chains of glucose sub-units joined together; forming a large
                                             insoluble molecule (see Chapter 4). Being insoluble makes glycogen a good
                                            storage product_ When the body is short of glucose; the glycogen can be
                                             broken down into glucose, which then passes into the bloodstream:
                                             Adrenaline raises blood glucose concentration in an emergency, but other
                                             hormones act all the time to control the level, keeping itfairlyconstant at a
                                             little less than 1 g of glucose in every dm: (cubic decimetre) of blood. The main
                                             hormone controlling glucose is insulin. Insulin is made by special cells in the
                                             pancreas. It stimulates the liver cells to take up glucose and convert it into
                                             glycogen; lowering the level of glucose in the blood:

      DID YOU KNOW?                          The concentration of glucose in your blood will start to rise after you have had
                                             a meal:Sugars from digested carbohydrate pass into the blood and are carried

      hormone calledglucagon;                converted to glycogen; so the blood leaving the liver in the hepatic vein has a
      which has the opposite effect to       lower concentration of glucose than when it enters the liver:

                                             Some people have a disease where their pancreas cannot make enough
                                             insulin to keep their blood glucose level constant it rises to very high
                                             concentrations The disease is called diabetes. One symptom of diabetes can
                                             be detected by a chemical test on urine: Normally, people have no glucose
                                             at all in their urine_ Someone suffering from diabetes may have such a high
                                             concentration of glucose in the blood that it is excreted in their urine_ This can
                                             be shown up by using coloured test strips (Figure 7.5).
                                                 KEY POINT
                                                 We should really refer to this disease by its full name, which is 'type 1' diabetes. There
                                              is also a 'type 2' diabetes; where the pancreas produces insulin but the body shows
                                                 insulin resistance, where insulin has less effect than it should do. At first the pancreas
                                                 makes extra insulin, but eventually it can't continue to make enough to maintain blood
                                                 glucose at a normal level. Type 2 diabetes is common in people who are overweight
                                                 and eat a poor diet that is high in sugar and other carbohydrates_ It can be prevented
                                                 and controlled by eating a good diet and doing regular exercise. Type 2 diabetes also

                                             Another symptom of diabetes is a constant thirst: This is because the high
                                             blood glucose concentration stimulates receptors in the hypothalamus of the
                                             brain: These 'thirst centres' are stimulated, so that by drinking; the person will

                                             Severe diabetes is very serious. If it is untreated, the sufferer loses weight and
                                             becomes weak and eventually falls into a coma and dies_
                                             Carbohydrates in the diet; such as starch and sugars, are the source of
                                             glucose in the blood,so a person with diabetes can help to control their blood

 DID YOU KNOW?
 Insulin for the treatment of
 diabetes has been available
 since 1921, and has kept
 millions of people alive: It was
 originally extracted from the                              %
 pancreases of animals and
 much insulin is still obtained
 in this way: However; since
 the 1970s, human insulin has
 been produced commercially,
 from genetically modified (GM)
 bacteria: The bacteria have their
 DNA 'engineered' to contain
 the gene for human insulin (see
 Chapter 21).                             Figure 7.6 Sensor for measuring blood glucose
