# 4 FOOD AND DIGESTION

Food is essential for life. The nutrients obtained from it are used in many different ways by the body. This chapter looks at the different kinds of food, and how the food is broken down by the digestive system and absorbed into the blood, so that it can be carried to all the tissues of the body.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

- Identify the chemical elements present in carbohydrates, proteins and lipids (fats and oils)
- Describe the structure of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids as large molecules made up from smaller basic units – starch and glycogen from simple sugars, protein from amino acids, and lipids from fatty acids and glycerol
- Investigate food samples for the presence of glucose, starch, protein and fat
- Understand that a balanced diet should include appropriate proportions of carbohydrate, protein, lipid, vitamins, minerals, water and dietary fibre
- Identify the sources and describe the functions of carbohydrate, lipid, protein, vitamins A, C and D, the mineral ions calcium and iron, water, and dietary fibre as components of the diet
- Understand how energy requirements vary with activity levels, age and pregnancy
- Describe the structure and function of the human alimentary canal, including the mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine (duodenum and ileum), large intestine (colon and rectum) and pancreas
- Understand how food is moved through the gut by peristalsis
- Understand the role of digestive enzymes, including the digestion of starch to glucose by amylase and maltase, the digestion of proteins to amino acids by proteases and the digestion of lipids to fatty acids and glycerol by lipases
- Understand that bile is produced by the liver and stored in the gall bladder, and understand the role of bile in neutralising stomach acid and emulsifying lipids
- Understand how the small intestine is adapted for absorption, including the structure of a villus

We need food for three main reasons:

- to supply us with a 'fuel' for energy
- to provide materials for growth and repair of tissues
- to help fight disease and keep our bodies healthy.

## A BALANCED DIET

The food that we eat is called our diet. No matter what you like to eat, your diet must include the following five groups of food substances if your body is to work properly and stay healthy – carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, minerals and vitamins – along with dietary fibre and water. Food should provide you with all of these substances, but they must also be present in the right amounts. A diet that provides enough of these substances and in the correct proportions to keep you healthy is called a balanced diet (Figure 4.1). We will look at each type of food in turn, to find out about its chemistry and the role that it plays in the body.

temperature, but melts if you warm it up. On the other hand, plant lipids are usually liquid at room temperature, and are called oils. Meat, butter, cheese, milk, eggs and oily fish are all rich in animal fats, as well as foods fried in animal fat. Vegetable oils include many types used for cooking, such as olive oil, corn oil and rapeseed oil, as well as products made from oils, such as margarine (Figure 4.3).

Lipids make up about 10% of our body's mass. They form an essential part of the structure of all cells, and fat is deposited in certain parts of the body as a long-term store of energy, for example under the skin and around the heart and kidneys. The fat layer under the skin acts as insulation, reducing heat loss through the surface of the body. Fat around organs such as the kidneys also helps to protect them from mechanical damage.

The chemical 'building blocks' of lipids are two types of molecule called glycerol and fatty acids. Glycerol is an oily liquid. It is also known as glycerine, and is used in many types of cosmetics. In lipids, a molecule of glycerol is joined to three fatty acid molecules. There are many different fatty acid molecules, which give us the many different kinds of lipid found in food (Figure 4.4).

Although lipids are an essential part of our diet, too much lipid is unhealthy, especially a type called saturated fat, and a lipid compound called cholesterol. These substances have been linked to heart disease (see Chapter 5).

Figure 4.4 depicts lipids made up of a molecule of glycerol joined to three fatty acids. The many different fatty acids form the variable part of the molecule.

### KEY POINT
Cholesterol is a substance that the body gets from food such as eggs and meat, but we also make cholesterol in our liver. It is an essential part of all cells, but too much cholesterol causes heart disease.

### DID YOU KNOW?
Saturated lipids (saturated fats) are more common in food from animal sources, such as meat and dairy products. 'Saturated' is a word used in chemistry, which means that the fatty acids of the lipids contain no double bonds. Other lipids are unsaturated, which means that their fatty acids contain double bonds. These are more common in plant oils. There is evidence that unsaturated lipids are healthier for us than saturated ones.

## PROTEINS

Proteins make up about 18% of the mass of the body. This is the second largest percentage after water. All cells contain protein, so we need it for growth and repair of tissues. Many compounds in the body are made from protein, including enzymes.

Most foods contain some protein, but certain foods such as meat, fish, cheese and eggs are particularly rich in it. You will notice that these foods are animal products. Plant material generally contains less protein, but some foods, especially beans, peas and nuts, are richer in protein than others.

However, we don't need much protein in our diet to stay healthy. Doctors recommend a maximum daily intake of about 70g. In more economically developed countries, people often eat far more protein than they need, whereas in many poorer countries a protein-deficiency disease called kwashiorkor is common (Figure 4.5).

Figure 4.5 shows a child suffering from a lack of protein in his diet, a disease called kwashiorkor. His swollen belly is not due to a full stomach, but is caused by fluid collecting in the tissues. Other symptoms include loss of weight, poor muscle growth, general weakness and flaky skin.

Like starch, proteins are also polymers, but whereas starch is made from a single molecular building block (glucose), proteins are made from 20 different sub-units called amino acids. All amino acids contain four chemical elements: carbon, hydrogen and oxygen (as in carbohydrates and fats) along with nitrogen. Two amino acids also contain sulfur. The amino acids are linked together in long chains, which are usually folded up or twisted into spirals, with cross-links holding the chains together (Figure 4.6).

Figure 4.6 (a) A chain of amino acids forming part of a protein molecule. Each shape represents a different amino acid. (b) A computer model of the protein insulin. This substance, like all proteins, is made of a long chain of amino acids arranged in a particular order and folded into a specific shape.

The shape of a protein is very important in allowing it to carry out its function, and the order of amino acids in the protein decides its shape. Because there are 20 different amino acids, and they can be arranged in any order, the number of different protein structures that can be made is enormous. As a result, there are thousands of different kinds of proteins in organisms, from structural proteins such as collagen and keratin in skin and nails, to proteins with more specific functions, such as enzymes and haemoglobin.

## EXTENSION WORK

Humans can make about half of the 20 amino acids that they need, but the other 10 have to be taken in as part of the diet. These 10 are called essential amino acids. There are higher amounts of essential amino acids in meat, fish, eggs and dairy products. If you are a vegetarian, you can still get all the essential amino acids you need, as long as you eat a varied diet that includes a range of different plant materials.

## MINERALS

All the foods you have read about so far are made from just five chemical elements: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur. Our bodies contain many other elements that we get from our food as 'minerals' or 'mineral ions'. Some are present in large amounts in the body, for example calcium, which is used for making teeth and bones. Others are present in much smaller amounts, but still have essential jobs to do. For instance our bodies contain about 3g of iron, but without it our blood would not be able to carry oxygen. Table 4.1 shows just a few of these minerals and the reasons they are needed.

Table 4.1 Some examples of minerals needed by the body:

| Mineral    | Approximate mass in an adult body / g | Location or role in body | Examples of foods rich in minerals |
|------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| calcium    | 1000                                  | making teeth and bones   | dairy products, fish, bread, vegetables |
| phosphorus | 650                                   | making teeth and bones; part of many chemicals, e.g. DNA and ATP | most foods |
| sodium     | 100                                   | in body fluids, e.g. blood | common salt, most foods |
| chlorine   | 100                                   | in body fluids, e.g. blood | common salt, most foods |
| magnesium  | 30                                    | making bones; found inside cells | green vegetables |
| iron       | 3                                     | part of haemoglobin in red blood cells, helps carry oxygen | red meat, liver, eggs, some vegetables, e.g. spinach |
---
If a person doesn't get enough of a mineral from their diet, they will show the symptoms of a 'mineral deficiency disease'. For example, a one-year-old child needs to consume about 0.6g (600 mg) of calcium every day, to make the bones grow properly and harden. Anything less than this over a prolonged period could result in poor bone development. The bones become deformed, a disease called rickets (Figure 4.7). Rickets can also be caused by lack of vitamin D in the diet (see below).

Similarly, 16-year-olds need about 12 mg of iron in their daily food intake. If they don't get this amount, they can't make enough haemoglobin for their red blood cells (see Chapter 5). This causes a condition called anaemia. People who are anaemic become tired and lack energy, because their blood doesn't carry enough oxygen.

Figure 4.7 An x-ray of the legs of a child showing the symptoms of rickets.

## VITAMINS

During the early part of the twentieth century, experiments were carried out that identified another class of food substances. When young laboratory rats were fed a diet of pure carbohydrate, lipid and protein, they all became ill and died. If they were fed on the same pure foods with a little added milk, they grew normally. The milk contained chemicals that the rats needed in small amounts to stay healthy. These chemicals are called vitamins. The results of one of these experiments are shown in Figure 4.8.

| Time (days) | No milk | Fed milk | Milk stopped |
|-------------|---------|----------|--------------|
| 0           | 45      | 45       | -            |
| 10          | 50      | 65       | -            |
| 20          | 48      | 78       | 78           |
| 30          | 55      | 82       | 75           |
| 40          | 65      | 80       | 72           |
| 50          | 75      | 73       | 72           |

Figure 4.8 Rats were fed a diet of pure carbohydrate, lipid and protein, with and without added milk. Vitamins in the milk had a dramatic effect on their growth.

At first, the chemical nature of vitamins was not known, and they were given letters to distinguish between them, such as vitamin A, vitamin B and so on. Each was identified by the effect a lack of the vitamin (vitamin deficiency) had on the body. For example, vitamin D is needed for growing bones to take up calcium salts. A deficiency of this vitamin can result in rickets (Figure 4.7), just as a lack of calcium can.

We now know the chemical structure of the vitamins and the exact ways in which they work in the body. As with vitamin D, each has a particular function. Vitamin A is needed to make a light-sensitive chemical in the retina of the eye (see Chapter 6). A lack of this vitamin causes night blindness, where the

person finds it difficult to see in dim light. Vitamin C is needed to make fibres
of a material called connective tissue. This acts as a 'glue', bonding cells
together in a tissue. It is found in the walls of blood vessels and in the skin
and lining surfaces of the body. Vitamin C deficiency leads to a disease called
scurvy, where wounds fail to heal, and bleeding occurs in various places in
the body. This is especially noticeable in the gums (Figure 4.9).

![Figure 4.9 Vitamin C helps lining cells such as those in the mouth and gums stick to each other. Lack of vitamin C causes scurvy, where the mouth and gums become damaged and bleed.]

Vitamin B is not a single substance, but a collection of many different
substances called the vitamin B group. It includes vitamins B1 (thiamine), B2
(riboflavin) and B3 (niacin). These compounds are involved in the process of
cell respiration. Different deficiency diseases result if any of them are missing
from the diet. For example, lack of vitamin B1 results in the weakening of the
muscles and paralysis, a disease called beri-beri.

The main vitamins, their role in the body and some foods which are good
sources of each, are summarised in Table 4.2.

Notice that the amounts of vitamins that we need are very small, but we
cannot stay healthy without them.

Table 4.2 Summary of the main vitamins. Note that you only need remember the sources and functions of vitamins A, C and D.

| Vitamin | Recommended daily amount in diet¹ | Use in the body | Effect of deficiency | Some foods that are a good source of the vitamin |
|---------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| A | 0.8 mg | making a chemical in the retina; also protects the surface of the eye | night blindness, damaged cornea of eye | fish liver oils, liver, butter, margarine, carrots |
| B1 | 1.1 mg | helps with cell respiration | beri-beri | yeast extract, cereals |
| B2 | 1.4 mg | helps with cell respiration | poor growth, dry skin | green vegetables, eggs, fish |
| B3 | 16 mg | helps with cell respiration | pellagra (dry red skin, poor growth, and digestive disorders) | liver, meat, fish. |
| C | 80 mg | sticks together cells lining surfaces such as the mouth | scurvy | fresh fruit and vegetables |
| D | 5 μg | helps bones absorb calcium and phosphate | rickets, poor teeth | fish liver oils; also made in skin in sunlight |

¹Figures are the European Union's recommended daily intake for an adult (2012). 'mg' stands for milligram (a thousandth of a gram) and 'μg' for microgram (a millionth of a gram).

## FOOD TESTS

It is possible to carry out simple chemical tests to find out if a food contains
starch, glucose, protein or lipid. Practical 8 uses pure substances for the tests,
but it is possible to do them on normal foods too. Unless the food is a liquid
like milk, it needs to be cut up into small pieces and ground with a pestle and
mortar, then shaken with some water in a test tube. This is done to extract the
components of the food and dissolve any soluble substances such as sugars.

DID YOU KNOW?
The cure for scurvy was
discovered as long ago as
1753. Sailors on long voyages
often got scurvy because they
ate very little fresh fruit and
vegetables (the main source
of vitamin C). A ship's doctor
called James Lind wrote an
account of how the disease
could quickly be cured by eating
fresh oranges and lemons.
The famous explorer Captain
Cook, on his world voyages in
1772 and 1775, kept his sailors
healthy by making sure that
they ate fresh fruit. By 1804,
all British sailors were made
to drink lime juice to prevent
scurvy. This is how they came
to be called 'limeys', a word that
was later used by Americans for
all British people.

## ACTIVITY 3

### PRACTICAL: TEST FOR STARCH

A little starch is placed on a spotting tile. A drop of yellow-brown iodine solution is added to the starch. The iodine reacts with the starch, forming a very dark blue, or 'blue-black' colour (Figure 4.10 (a)). Starch is insoluble, but this test will work on a solid sample of food, such as potato, or a suspension of starch in water.

Figure 4.10a Testing for starch using iodine

### PRACTICAL: TEST FOR GLUCOSE

Glucose is called a reducing sugar. This is because the test for glucose involves reducing an alkaline solution of copper (II) sulfate to copper (I) oxide.

A small spatula measure of glucose is placed in a test tube and a little water added (about 2 cm deep). The tube is shaken to dissolve the glucose. Several drops of Benedict's solution are added to the tube, enough to colour the mixture blue (Figure 4.10 (b)).

A water bath is prepared by half-filling a beaker with water and heating it on a tripod and gauze. The test tube is placed in the beaker and the water allowed to boil (using a water bath is safer than heating the tube directly in the Bunsen burner). After a few seconds the clear blue solution gradually changes colour, forming a cloudy orange or 'brick red' precipitate of copper (I) oxide (Figure 4.10 (b)).

All other 'single' sugars (monosaccharides), such as fructose, are reducing sugars, as well as some 'double' sugars (disaccharides), such as the milk sugar, lactose. However, ordinary table sugar (sucrose) is not. If sucrose is boiled with Benedict's solution it will stay a clear blue colour.

Figure 4.10b Glucose with Benedict's solution, before and after heating

### PRACTICAL: TEST FOR PROTEIN

The test for protein is sometimes called the 'biuret' test, after the coloured compound that is formed.

A little protein, such as powdered egg white (albumen), is placed in a test tube and about 2 cm depth of water added. The tube is shaken to mix the powder with the water. An equal volume of dilute (5%) potassium hydroxide solution is added and the tube shaken again. Finally two drops of 1% copper sulfate solution are added. A purple colour develops. (Sometimes these two solutions are supplied already mixed together as 'biuret solution'.)

### PRACTICAL: TEST FOR LIPID

Fats and oils are insoluble in water, but will dissolve in ethanol (alcohol). The test for lipid uses this fact.

A pipette is used to place one drop of olive oil in the bottom of a test tube. About 2cm depth of ethanol is added, and the tube is shaken to dissolve the oil. The solution is poured into a test tube that is about three-quarters full with cold water. A white cloudy layer forms on the top of the water. The white layer is caused by the ethanol dissolving in the water and leaving the lipid behind as a suspension of tiny droplets, called an emulsion.

Figure 4.11 Food packaging is labelled with the proportions of different food types that it contains, along with its energy content. The energy in units called kilocalories (kcal) is also shown, but scientists no longer use this old-fashioned unit.

## ENERGY FROM FOOD

Some foods contain more energy than others. It depends on the proportions of carbohydrate, lipid and protein that they contain. Their energy content is measured in kilojoules (kJ). If a gram of carbohydrate is fully oxidised, it produces about 17 kJ, whereas a gram of lipid yields over twice as much as this (39 kJ). Protein can produce about 18 kJ per gram. If you look on a food label, it usually shows the energy content of the food, along with the amounts of different nutrients that it contains (Figure 4.11).

Foods with a high percentage of lipid, such as butter or nuts, contain a large amount of energy. Others, like fruits and vegetables, which are mainly composed of water, have a much lower energy content (Table 4.3).

                                            Food, such as a piece of bread, contains carbohydrates, lipids and proteins,
                                            but they are not the same carbohydrates, lipids and proteins as in our tissues_
                                            The components of the bread must first be broken down into their 'building
                                            blocks' before they can be absorbed through the wall of the gut: This process

                                         of the gut also help with mechanical digestion. For example, muscles in the
                                         wall of the stomach contract to churn up the food while it isbeingchemically

                                         intestine contain two layers of muscles_ One layer has fibres arranged in rings
                                         around the gut: This is the circular muscle layer: The other has fibres running
                                         along the length of the gut; and is called the longitudinal muscle layer: Together
                                         these two layers act to push the food along: When the circular muscles contract
                                         and the longitudinal muscles relax; the gut is made narrower: When the opposite
                                         happens, i.e. the longitudinal muscles contract and the circular muscles relax;

## THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM

Figure 4.14 shows a simplified diagram of the human digestive system. It is simplified so that you can see the order of the organs along the gut. The real gut is much longer than this, and coiled up so that it fills the whole space of the abdomen. Overall, its length in an adult is about 8m. This gives plenty of time for the food to be broken down and absorbed as it passes through the gut.

[A diagram of the human digestive system is shown, with the following parts labeled:]

- Salivary gland
- Mouth
- Tongue
- Oesophagus (gullet)
- Trachea (wind pipe)
- Liver
- Stomach
- Gall bladder
- Pancreas
- Small intestine:
  - Duodenum
  - Ileum
- Large intestine:
  - Colon
  - Rectum
- Appendix
- Anus

The mouth, stomach and the first part of the small intestine (called the duodenum) all break down the food using enzymes, either made in the gut wall itself, or by glands such as the pancreas. Digestion continues in the last part of the small intestine (the ileum) and it is here that the digested food is absorbed. The last part of the gut, the large intestine, is mainly concerned with absorbing water out of the remains, and storing the waste products (faeces) before they are removed from the body.

                                           The three main classes of food are broken down by three classes of enzymes_
                                           Carbohydrates are digested by enzymes called carbohydrases. Proteins are
                                           acted upon by proteases, and enzymes called lipases break down lipids_
                                           Some of the places in the gut where these enzymes are made are shown in
                                           Table 4.5.

                                           The food is held in the stomach for several hours; while initial digestion of
                                           protein takes place. The stomach wall secretes hydrochloric acid, so the
                                           stomach contents are strongly acidic. This has a very important function. It kills
                                           bacteria that are taken into the gut along with the food, helping to protect us
                                           from food poisoning: The protease enzyme that is made in the stomach; called
                                           pepsin, has to be able to work in these acidic conditions, and has an optimum
                                           pH value of about 2. This is unusually low    most enzymes work best at near
                                           neutral conditions (see Chapter 1).

60   ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY                         FOOD AND DIGESTION

Several digestive enzymes are added to the food in the duodenum. These are made by the pancreas, and digest starch, proteins and lipids (Table 4.5). As well as this, the liver makes a digestive juice called bile. Bile is a green liquid that is stored in the gall bladder and passes down the bile duct on to the food. Bile does not contain enzymes, but has another important function. It turns any large lipid globules in the food into an emulsion of tiny droplets (Figure 4.16). This increases the surface area of the lipid, so that lipase enzymes can break it down more easily.

Bile and pancreatic juice have another function. They are both alkaline. The mixture of semi-digested food and enzymes coming from the stomach is acidic, and needs to be neutralised by the addition of alkali before it continues on its way through the gut.

As the food continues along the intestine, more enzymes are added, until the parts of the food that can be digested have been fully broken down into soluble end products, which can be absorbed. This is the role of the last part of the small intestine, the ileum.

Figure 4.16 Bile turns fats into an emulsion of tiny droplets for easier digestion.

## ABSORPTION IN THE ILEUM

The ileum is highly adapted to absorb the digested food. The lining of the ileum has a very large surface area, which means that it can quickly and efficiently absorb the soluble products of digestion into the blood. The length of the intestine helps to provide a large surface area, and this is aided by folds in its lining, but the greatest increase in area is due to tiny projections from the lining, called villi (Figure 4.17).

Figure 4.17 (a) The inside lining of the ileum is adapted to absorb digested food by the presence of millions of tiny villi. (b) Photo of the inside a patient's ileum, taken using a camera attached to an endoscope. You can see thousands of tiny villi covering the lining.

The singular of villi is 'villus'. Each villus is only about 1-2 mm long, but there are millions of them, so that the total area of the lining is thought to be about 300 m². This provides a massive area in contact with the digested food. As well as this, high-powered microscopy has revealed that the surface cells of each villus themselves have hundreds of minute projections, called microvilli, which increase the surface area for absorption even more (Figure 4.18).

Each villus contains a network of blood capillaries. Most of the digested food enters these blood vessels, but the products of fat digestion, as well as tiny fat droplets, enter a tube in the middle of the villus, called a lacteal. The lacteals form part of the body's lymphatic system, which transports a liquid called lymph. This lymph eventually drains into the blood system too.

Diagram of a villus structure

Figure 4.18 Each villus contains blood vessels and a lacteal, which absorb the products of digestion. The surface cells of the villus are covered with microvilli, which further increase the surface area for absorption.

The surface of a villus is made of a single layer of cells called an epithelium. This means that there is only a short distance between the digested food in the ileum and the blood capillaries making it easier for the products of digestion to diffuse through and enter the blood. The epithelium cells contain many mitochondria, which supply the energy needed for active transport of some substances.

In addition each villus contains muscle fibres which contract to move the villus. The villi are in constant motion, keeping them in contact with the contents of the ileum and maintaining a steep concentration gradient for diffusion of the products of digestion.

The blood vessels from the ileum join up to form a large blood vessel called the hepatic portal vein, which leads to the liver (see Chapter 5). The liver acts rather like a food processing factory, breaking some molecules down, and building up and storing others. For example, glucose from carbohydrate digestion is converted into glycogen and stored in the liver. Later, the glycogen can be converted back into glucose when the body needs it (see Chapter 7).

The digested food molecules are distributed around the body by the blood system (see Chapter 5). The soluble food molecules are absorbed from the blood into cells of tissues, and are used to build new parts of cells. This is called assimilation.

## KEY POINT

Removal of faeces by the body is sometimes incorrectly called excretion. Excretion is a word that only applies to materials that are the waste products of cells of the body, such as carbon dioxide. Faeces are not products of cell metabolism - they consist of waste that has passed through the gut and left the body via the anus, without entering the cells. The correct name for this process is egestion.

## THE LARGE INTESTINE – ELIMINATION OF WASTE

By the time that the contents of the gut have reached the end of the small intestine, most of the digested food, as well as most of the water, has been absorbed. The waste material consists mainly of cellulose (fibre) and other indigestible remains, water, dead and living bacteria and cells lost from the lining of the gut. The function of the first part of the large intestine, called the colon, is to absorb most of the remaining water from the contents, leaving a semi-solid waste material called faeces. This is stored in the rectum, until expelled out of the body through the anus.
