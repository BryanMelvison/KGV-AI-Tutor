# CHAPTER 4: FOOD AND DIGESTION

FOOD IS ESSENTIAL FOR LIFE AS IT PROVIDES NUTRIENTS NECESSARY FOR ENERGY, GROWTH, AND HEALTH. THIS CHAPTER EXPLORES FOOD TYPES, DIGESTION PROCESSES, AND NUTRIENT ABSORPTION.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

BY UNDERSTANDING THIS CHAPTER, READERS WILL BE ABLE TO:

1. IDENTIFY CHEMICAL ELEMENTS IN CARBOHYDRATES, PROTEINS, AND LIPIDS.
2. DESCRIBE THE STRUCTURE OF THESE MOLECULES, INCLUDING THEIR BASIC UNITS.
3. ANALYZE FOOD SAMPLES FOR GLUCOSE, STARCH, PROTEIN, AND FAT.
4. UNDERSTAND A BALANCED DIET'S IMPORTANCE, INCLUDING ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS.
5. DETERMINE FOOD SOURCES AND FUNCTIONS, SUCH AS ENERGY AND TISSUE REPAIR.
6. RECOGNIZE HOW ENERGY NEEDS VARY WITH ACTIVITY, AGE, AND PREGNANCY.

## THE IMPORTANCE OF FOOD

FOOD SERVES THREE CRITICAL ROLES: PROVIDING ENERGY, SUPPORTING TISSUE GROWTH, AND AIDING IN DISEASE PREVENTION. A BALANCED DIET ENSURES THESE NEEDS ARE MET WITH APPROPRIATE NUTRIENTS.

### A BALANCED DIET

A HEALTHY DIET INCLUDES CARBOHYDRATES, PROTEINS, LIPIDS, VITAMINS, MINERALS, FIBER, AND WATER. EACH COMPONENT IS ESSENTIAL FOR BODILY FUNCTIONS. A BALANCED INTAKE OF THESE ELEMENTS SUPPORTS OVERALL HEALTH.

## THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM

THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM BREAKS DOWN FOOD INTO ABSORBABLE COMPONENTS. KEY STRUCTURES INCLUDE THE MOUTH, ESOPHAGUS, STOMACH, SMALL INTESTINE (DUODENUM AND ILEUM), LARGE INTESTINE (COLON AND RECTUM), AND PANCREAS.

### PERISTALSIS

PERISTALSIS MOVES FOOD THROUGH THE GUT VIA RHYTHMIC MUSCLE CONTRACTIONS, AIDING DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION.

### DIGESTIVE ENZYMES

ENZYMES FACILITATE NUTRIENT BREAKDOWN:
- AMYLASE AND MALTASE CONVERT STARCH INTO GLUCOSE.
- PROTEASES BREAK PROTEINS INTO AMINO ACIDS.
- LIPASES DIGEST LIPIDS INTO FATTY ACIDS AND GLYCEROL.

### BILE

BILE, PRODUCED BY THE LIVER AND STORED IN THE GALL BLADDER, NEUTRALIZES STOMACH ACID AND AIDS LIPID DIGESTION BY EMULSIFYING THEM.

### ABSORPTION IN THE SMALL INTESTINE

THE SMALL INTESTINE'S VILLI ENHANCE NUTRIENT ABSORPTION, FACILITATING EFFICIENT NUTRIENT UPTAKE.

UNDERSTANDING FOOD AND DIGESTION IS VITAL FOR HEALTH, ENSURING NUTRIENTS ARE ABSORBED EFFECTIVELY TO SUPPORT BODILY FUNCTIONS.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: CARBOHYDRATES AND LIPIDS

## CARBOHYDRATES

### WHAT ARE CARBOHYDRATES?
CARBOHYDRATES ARE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS COMPOSED OF CARBON, HYDROGEN, AND OXYGEN. THE CHEMICAL FORMULA FOR GLUCOSE, A SIMPLE SUGAR, IS C₆H₁₂O₆. THESE MOLECULES ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO ENERGY PRODUCTION IN ANIMALS.

### TYPES OF CARBOHYDRATES
CARBOHYDRATES CAN BE CATEGORIZED INTO THREE MAIN TYPES:

1. **MONOSACCHARIDES**: THE SIMPLEST SUGARS, SUCH AS GLUCOSE AND FRUCTOSE.
2. **DISACCHARIDES**: FORMED BY THE COMBINATION OF TWO MONOSACCHARIDES, LIKE SUCROSE (GLUCOSE + FRUCTOSE) AND LACTOSE (GLUCOSE + GALACTOSE).
3. **POLYSACCHARIDES**: COMPLEX CARBOHYDRATES MADE FROM CHAINS OF MONOSACCHARIDE UNITS, INCLUDING STARCH, GLYCOGEN, AND CELLULOSE.

### FUNCTIONS OF CARBOHYDRATES
CARBOHYDRATES ARE ESSENTIAL FOR ENERGY, MAKING UP ABOUT 1% OF BODY MASS. THEY SERVE AS THE PRIMARY ENERGY SOURCE THROUGH CELL RESPIRATION, WHERE GLUCOSE IS OXIDIZED TO RELEASE ENERGY.

- **SOURCES**: NATURAL SOURCES INCLUDE FRUITS, VEGETABLES, AND FOODS LIKE POTATOES, RICE, AND WHEAT, WHICH CONTAIN SUGARS SUCH AS GLUCOSE AND FRUCTOSE.
- **DIGESTION**: COMPLEX CARBOHYDRATES ARE BROKEN DOWN INTO SIMPLE SUGARS DURING DIGESTION. DIETARY FIBER, FOUND IN CELLULOSE, AIDS IN FOOD MOVEMENT THROUGH THE INTESTINES AND PREVENTS CONSTIPATION.

### LIPIDS (FATS AND OILS)

### WHAT ARE LIPIDS?
LIPIDS ARE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS RICH IN CARBON, HYDROGEN, AND OXYGEN, WITH A LOWER OXYGEN CONTENT THAN CARBOHYDRATES. AN EXAMPLE IS TRISTEARIN, A FAT FOUND IN BEEF AND LAMB, WITH THE FORMULA C₅₁H₁₀₈O₆.

### FUNCTIONS OF LIPIDS
LIPIDS PERFORM VARIOUS ROLES IN THE BODY, INCLUDING ENERGY STORAGE, INSULATION, AND FORMING CELL MEMBRANES. THEY ARE VITAL FOR HORMONE PRODUCTION, NUTRIENT ABSORPTION, AND OVERALL HEALTH.

## SUMMARY
CARBOHYDRATES AND LIPIDS ARE CRUCIAL MACROMOLECULES IN ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY. CARBOHYDRATES PRIMARILY PROVIDE ENERGY, WHILE LIPIDS STORE ENERGY AND SUPPORT CELLULAR STRUCTURE. THIS UNDERSTANDING IS KEY TO MAINTAINING A BALANCED DIET AND HEALTH.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: FOOD AND DIGESTION

## LIPIDS

LIPIDS ARE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF OUR DIET, COMPRISING APPROXIMATELY 10% OF THE BODY'S MASS. THEY PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN CELL STRUCTURE AND SERVE AS LONG-TERM ENERGY STORES, PARTICULARLY FOUND UNDER THE SKIN AND AROUND VITAL ORGANS SUCH AS THE HEART AND KIDNEYS.

### TYPES OF LIPIDS

- **ANIMAL FATS**: THESE ARE SOLID AT ROOM TEMPERATURE AND INCLUDE FOODS LIKE MEAT, BUTTER, CHEESE, MILK, EGGS, AND OILY FISH.
- **PLANT OILS**: TYPICALLY LIQUID AT ROOM TEMPERATURE, EXAMPLES INCLUDE OLIVE OIL, CORN OIL, AND RAPESEED OIL. MARGARINE IS A PRODUCT DERIVED FROM THESE OILS.

!FIGURE 4.3: FOODS RICH IN LIPIDS

THE CHEMICAL BUILDING BLOCKS OF LIPIDS ARE GLYCEROL AND FATTY ACIDS. GLYCEROL, ALSO KNOWN AS GLYCERINE, IS AN OILY LIQUID USED IN COSMETICS. IN LIPIDS, ONE GLYCEROL MOLECULE IS CONNECTED TO THREE FATTY ACID MOLECULES, RESULTING IN DIVERSE LIPID TYPES FOUND IN FOOD.

!FIGURE 4.4: STRUCTURE OF LIPIDS

### HEALTH IMPLICATIONS

WHILE LIPIDS ARE CRUCIAL FOR HEALTH, EXCESSIVE INTAKE, PARTICULARLY OF SATURATED FATS AND CHOLESTEROL, CAN LEAD TO CONDITIONS LIKE HEART DISEASE. SATURATED FATS ARE COMMON IN ANIMAL PRODUCTS, WHEREAS UNSATURATED FATS, GENERALLY HEALTHIER, ARE FOUND IN PLANT OILS.

**KEY POINT**: CHOLESTEROL IS OBTAINED FROM FOODS SUCH AS EGGS AND MEAT AND IS ALSO PRODUCED BY THE LIVER. WHILE ESSENTIAL FOR CELL FUNCTION, HIGH LEVELS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO HEART DISEASE.

## PROTEINS

PROTEINS MAKE UP ABOUT 18% OF THE BODY'S MASS, SECOND ONLY TO WATER. THEY ARE VITAL FOR GROWTH, TISSUE REPAIR, AND THE PRODUCTION OF VARIOUS COMPOUNDS, INCLUDING ENZYMES.

### SOURCES OF PROTEIN

MOST FOODS CONTAIN SOME PROTEIN, WITH ANIMAL PRODUCTS LIKE MEAT, FISH, CHEESE, AND EGGS BEING PARTICULARLY RICH SOURCES. PLANT-BASED PROTEINS, SUCH AS BEANS, PEAS, AND NUTS, ALSO PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS, THOUGH GENERALLY IN LESSER QUANTITIES THAN ANIMAL SOURCES.

!FIGURE 4.5: KWASHIORKOR

**DID YOU KNOW?**: IN DEVELOPED NATIONS, EXCESSIVE PROTEIN CONSUMPTION IS COMMON, WHILE IN POORER COUNTRIES, PROTEIN DEFICIENCY CAN LEAD TO DISEASES LIKE KWASHIORKOR, CHARACTERIZED BY SYMPTOMS INCLUDING A SWOLLEN BELLY, WEIGHT LOSS, AND POOR MUSCLE GROWTH.

### STRUCTURE OF PROTEINS

PROTEINS ARE POLYMERS COMPOSED OF 20 DIFFERENT SUBUNITS CALLED AMINO ACIDS. EACH AMINO ACID CONTAINS CARBON, HYDROGEN, OXYGEN, AND NITROGEN, WITH SOME ALSO CONTAINING SULFUR. THESE AMINO ACIDS FORM LONG CHAINS THAT FOLD INTO COMPLEX STRUCTURES, HELD TOGETHER BY CROSS-LINKS.

!FIGURE 4.6: STRUCTURE OF PROTEINS

IN SUMMARY, BOTH LIPIDS AND PROTEINS ARE ESSENTIAL MACRONUTRIENTS CRUCIAL FOR HEALTH AND BODILY FUNCTIONS. BALANCING THEIR INTAKE IS VITAL FOR OVERALL WELL-BEING.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: FOOD AND DIGESTION

## ESSENTIAL AMINO ACIDS

HUMANS CAN SYNTHESIZE ABOUT HALF OF THE 20 AMINO ACIDS REQUIRED. THE REMAINING 10, KNOWN AS ESSENTIAL AMINO ACIDS, MUST BE OBTAINED THROUGH DIET. FOODS RICH IN THESE INCLUDE MEAT, FISH, EGGS, AND DAIRY PRODUCTS.

VEGETARIANS CAN OBTAIN ALL ESSENTIAL AMINO ACIDS BY CONSUMING A VARIED DIET THAT INCLUDES DIVERSE PLANT MATERIALS.

A CHAIN OF AMINO ACIDS FORMS PART OF A PROTEIN MOLECULE, WITH EACH SHAPE REPRESENTING A DIFFERENT AMINO ACID.

## PROTEIN STRUCTURE

PROTEINS ARE COMPOSED OF LONG CHAINS OF AMINO ACIDS ARRANGED IN SPECIFIC SEQUENCES AND FOLDED INTO UNIQUE SHAPES. THIS STRUCTURE IS CRUCIAL FOR THEIR FUNCTION, AS THE SEQUENCE DETERMINES THE SHAPE.

WITH 20 DIFFERENT AMINO ACIDS AVAILABLE, THE POTENTIAL COMBINATIONS FOR PROTEIN STRUCTURES ARE VAST. THIS DIVERSITY LEADS TO THOUSANDS OF DISTINCT PROTEINS IN ORGANISMS, INCLUDING STRUCTURAL PROTEINS LIKE COLLAGEN AND KERATIN, AND FUNCTIONAL PROTEINS SUCH AS ENZYMES AND HEMOGLOBIN.

## MINERALS

IN ADDITION TO PROTEINS, MINERALS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR BODILY FUNCTIONS. WHILE FOOD PRIMARILY CONTAINS CARBON, HYDROGEN, OXYGEN, NITROGEN, AND SULFUR, OTHER ELEMENTS CALLED MINERALS OR MINERAL IONS ARE ALSO NECESSARY.

### IMPORTANCE OF MINERALS

SOME MINERALS ARE PRESENT IN LARGE QUANTITIES, SUCH AS CALCIUM, VITAL FOR TOOTH AND BONE DEVELOPMENT. OTHERS, LIKE IRON, ARE NEEDED IN SMALLER AMOUNTS BUT ARE CRUCIAL FOR FUNCTIONS LIKE OXYGEN TRANSPORT IN THE BLOOD. THE BODY CONTAINS ABOUT 3 GRAMS OF IRON.

MINERALS PLAY VARIOUS ROLES IN THE BODY, INCLUDING CONTRIBUTING TO CHEMICALS LIKE DNA AND ATP, AND MAINTAINING BODILY FLUIDS SUCH AS BLOOD. EXAMPLES INCLUDE CALCIUM, PHOSPHORUS, SODIUM, CHLORINE, MAGNESIUM, AND IRON.

### MINERAL SOURCES

CALCIUM IS FOUND IN DAIRY PRODUCTS, FISH, BREAD, AND VEGETABLES. PHOSPHORUS IS WIDESPREAD IN FOODS. SODIUM AND CHLORINE ARE ABUNDANT IN COMMON SALT AND MOST FOODS. MAGNESIUM IS PRESENT IN GREEN VEGETABLES. IRON CAN BE OBTAINED FROM RED MEAT, LIVER, EGGS, AND SOME VEGETABLES LIKE SPINACH.

UNDERSTANDING THESE NUTRIENTS IS CRUCIAL FOR MAINTAINING A HEALTHY DIET AND SUPPORTING BODILY FUNCTIONS.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: FOOD AND DIGESTION

## MINERAL DEFICIENCIES

MINERALS ARE ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS REQUIRED IN SMALL AMOUNTS FOR BODILY FUNCTIONS. A ONE-YEAR-OLD CHILD NEEDS APPROXIMATELY **0.6G (600 MG)** OF CALCIUM DAILY TO SUPPORT BONE DEVELOPMENT. PROLONGED INSUFFICIENT CALCIUM INTAKE CAN LEAD TO RICKETS, CHARACTERIZED BY DEFORMED BONES (FIGURE 4.7). RICKETS IS ALSO LINKED TO A DEFICIENCY OF VITAMIN D.

TEENAGERS AGED 16 REQUIRE ABOUT **12MG OF IRON** DAILY. A LACK OF IRON CAN IMPAIR RED BLOOD CELL PRODUCTION, CAUSING ANAEMIA. INDIVIDUALS WITH ANAEMIA OFTEN EXPERIENCE FATIGUE DUE TO REDUCED OXYGEN-CARRYING CAPACITY IN THEIR BLOOD.

## VITAMINS

IN THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY, RESEARCHERS DISCOVERED VITAMINS AS CRUCIAL NUTRIENTS. EXPERIMENTS WITH RATS SHOWED THAT A DIET LACKING ESSENTIAL CHEMICALS CAUSED ILLNESS AND DEATH. ADDING MILK TO THEIR DIET ENABLED THEIR SURVIVAL, HIGHLIGHTING THE ROLE OF VITAMINS IN HEALTH.

INITIALLY, VITAMINS WERE LABELED WITH LETTERS (E.G., VITAMIN A) BASED ON DEFICIENCY EFFECTS. VITAMIN D IS VITAL FOR CALCIUM ABSORPTION, LINKED TO RICKETS PREVENTION (FIGURE 4.7). TODAY, WE UNDERSTAND VITAMIN STRUCTURES AND FUNCTIONS; VITAMIN A AIDS IN PRODUCING A LIGHT-SENSITIVE CHEMICAL IN THE RETINA, ESSENTIAL FOR VISION. DEFICIENCY CAN CAUSE NIGHT BLINDNESS.

BOTH MINERALS AND VITAMINS ARE CRUCIAL FOR HEALTH, WITH DEFICIENCIES LEADING TO SIGNIFICANT ISSUES.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: FOOD AND DIGESTION

THE CURE FOR SCURVY WAS DISCOVERED AS EARLY AS 1753 WHEN JAMES LIND OBSERVED THAT FRESH ORANGES AND LEMONS COULD PREVENT THE DISEASE. SAILORS ON LONG VOYAGES OFTEN SUFFERED FROM SCURVY DUE TO A LACK OF FRESH PRODUCE, WHICH ARE RICH SOURCES OF VITAMIN C. THIS DEFICIENCY LEADS TO AN INABILITY TO HEAL WOUNDS AND CAUSES BLEEDING IN VARIOUS BODY PARTS, PARTICULARLY THE GUMS.

VITAMIN C PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN MAINTAINING THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF TISSUES BY HELPING CELLS STICK TOGETHER. IT IS FOUND IN THE LINING OF BLOOD VESSELS AND BODY SURFACES. A DEFICIENCY IN VITAMIN C RESULTS IN SCURVY, CHARACTERIZED BY DELAYED WOUND HEALING AND BLEEDING, MOST NOTICEABLE IN THE GUMS.

THE VITAMIN B GROUP CONSISTS OF SEVERAL COMPOUNDS ESSENTIAL FOR CELL RESPIRATION, INCLUDING THIAMINE (B1), RIBOFLAVIN (B2), AND NIACIN (B3). EACH PLAYS A UNIQUE ROLE IN ENERGY PRODUCTION. DEFICIENCIES IN THESE VITAMINS CAN LEAD TO SERIOUS HEALTH ISSUES. FOR INSTANCE, A LACK OF THIAMINE CAUSES BERI-BERI, CHARACTERIZED BY MUSCLE WEAKNESS AND PARALYSIS.

THE ROLES OF VARIOUS VITAMINS, THEIR DEFICIENCIES, AND FOOD SOURCES ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW:

VITAMIN A IS ESSENTIAL FOR PRODUCING A CHEMICAL IN THE RETINA THAT PROTECTS THE EYE SURFACE. DEFICIENCIES CAN LEAD TO NIGHT BLINDNESS AND CORNEAL DAMAGE. GOOD SOURCES INCLUDE FISH LIVER OILS, LIVER, BUTTER, MARGARINE, AND CARROTS.

THIAMINE (B1) IS VITAL FOR CELL RESPIRATION. ITS DEFICIENCY CAUSES BERI-BERI, MARKED BY MUSCLE WEAKNESS AND PARALYSIS. FOOD SOURCES INCLUDE YEAST EXTRACT AND CEREALS.

RIBOFLAVIN (B2) AIDS IN ENERGY PRODUCTION. DEFICIENCIES RESULT IN POOR GROWTH AND DRY SKIN. IT CAN BE FOUND IN GREEN VEGETABLES, EGGS, AND FISH.

NIACIN (B3) HELPS IN MANAGING CHOLESTEROL LEVELS AND ENERGY METABOLISM. ITS DEFICIENCY LEADS TO PELLAGRA, CHARACTERIZED BY DRY RED SKIN, POOR GROWTH, AND DIGESTIVE DISORDERS. GOOD SOURCES INCLUDE LIVER, MEAT, AND FISH.

VITAMIN C IS CRUCIAL FOR MAINTAINING THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF BODY SURFACES. A DEFICIENCY CAUSES SCURVY, LEADING TO DELAYED WOUND HEALING AND BLEEDING IN GUMS AND OTHER AREAS. IT CAN BE OBTAINED FROM FRESH FRUIT AND VEGETABLES.

VITAMIN D AIDS IN CALCIUM ABSORPTION, ESSENTIAL FOR BONE HEALTH. ITS DEFICIENCY CAN CAUSE RICKETS IN CHILDREN AND TOOTH DECAY IN ADULTS. SOURCES INCLUDE FISH LIVER OILS AND SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE.

SIMPLE CHEMICAL TESTS CAN DETERMINE THE PRESENCE OF STARCH, GLUCOSE, PROTEIN, OR LIPIDS IN FOODS. THESE TESTS CAN BE PERFORMED ON GROUND FOOD SAMPLES USING BASIC LABORATORY EQUIPMENT. THE PROCESS INVOLVES EXTRACTING COMPONENTS AND DISSOLVING SOLUBLE SUBSTANCES LIKE SUGARS.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: FOOD AND DIGESTION

## PRACTICAL TESTS FOR NUTRIENTS

### TESTING FOR STARCH

TO TEST FOR STARCH, FOLLOW THESE STEPS:

1. PLACE A SMALL AMOUNT OF STARCH ON A SPOTTING TILE.
2. ADD A DROP OF YELLOW-BROWN IODINE SOLUTION TO THE STARCH.
3. OBSERVE THE REACTION: THE IODINE WILL REACT WITH THE STARCH, FORMING A VERY DARK BLUE OR 'BLUE-BLACK' COLOR.

STARCH IS INSOLUBLE IN WATER BUT CAN BE TESTED ON SOLID FOOD SAMPLES, SUCH AS POTATOES, OR IN A SUSPENSION OF STARCH IN WATER.

---

### TESTING FOR GLUCOSE

GLUCOSE IS CLASSIFIED AS A REDUCING SUGAR. THE TEST INVOLVES REDUCING AN ALKALINE SOLUTION OF COPPER (II) SULFATE TO COPPER (I) OXIDE. HERE’S HOW TO CONDUCT THE TEST:

1. PLACE A SMALL SPATULA MEASURE OF GLUCOSE IN A TEST TUBE AND ADD ABOUT 2 CM OF WATER. SHAKE THE TUBE TO DISSOLVE THE GLUCOSE.
2. ADD SEVERAL DROPS OF BENEDICT'S SOLUTION TO THE TUBE UNTIL THE MIXTURE TURNS BLUE.
3. PREPARE A WATER BATH BY HALF-FILLING A BEAKER WITH WATER AND HEATING IT ON A TRIPOD AND GAUZE.
4. PLACE THE TEST TUBE IN THE BOILING WATER BATH. AFTER A FEW SECONDS, OBSERVE THE COLOR CHANGE: THE CLEAR BLUE SOLUTION WILL GRADUALLY CHANGE TO A CLOUDY ORANGE OR 'BRICK RED' PRECIPITATE OF COPPER (I) OXIDE.

OTHER MONOSACCHARIDES (LIKE FRUCTOSE) AND SOME DISACCHARIDES (LIKE LACTOSE) ARE ALSO REDUCING SUGARS. HOWEVER, SUCROSE (TABLE SUGAR) DOES NOT REDUCE BENEDICT'S SOLUTION AND WILL REMAIN BLUE WHEN BOILED.

---

### TESTING FOR PROTEIN

THE TEST FOR PROTEIN IS KNOWN AS THE BIURET TEST. HERE’S HOW TO PERFORM IT:

1. PLACE A SMALL AMOUNT OF PROTEIN, SUCH AS POWDERED EGG WHITE (ALBUMEN), IN A TEST TUBE AND ADD ABOUT 2 CM OF WATER. SHAKE TO MIX.
2. ADD AN EQUAL VOLUME OF DILUTE (5%) POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE SOLUTION AND SHAKE AGAIN.
3. FINALLY, ADD TWO DROPS OF 1% COPPER SULFATE SOLUTION. A PURPLE COLOR WILL DEVELOP, INDICATING THE PRESENCE OF PROTEIN.

SOMETIMES, THE POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE AND COPPER SULFATE SOLUTIONS ARE ALREADY MIXED TOGETHER AND REFERRED TO AS 'BIURET SOLUTION'.

---

### TESTING FOR LIPIDS

FATS AND OILS ARE INSOLUBLE IN WATER BUT WILL DISSOLVE IN ETHANOL (ALCOHOL). TO TEST FOR LIPIDS, FOLLOW THESE STEPS:

1. USE A PIPETTE TO PLACE ONE DROP OF OLIVE OIL IN THE BOTTOM OF A TEST TUBE.
2. ADD ABOUT 2 CM OF ETHANOL AND SHAKE THE TUBE TO DISSOLVE THE OIL.
3. POUR THE SOLUTION INTO A TEST TUBE THAT IS ABOUT THREE-QUARTERS FULL OF COLD WATER.

OBSERVATION: A WHITE CLOUDY LAYER WILL FORM ON THE TOP OF THE WATER. THIS IS DUE TO THE ETHANOL DISSOLVING IN THE WATER AND LEAVING THE LIPID BEHIND AS A SUSPENSION OF TINY DROPLETS, KNOWN AS AN EMULSION.

---

BY CONDUCTING THESE PRACTICAL TESTS, YOU CAN IDENTIFY THE PRESENCE OF STARCH, GLUCOSE, PROTEIN, AND LIPIDS IN VARIOUS FOOD SAMPLES.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: FOOD AND DIGESTION

## ENERGY FROM FOOD

SOME FOODS CONTAIN MORE ENERGY THAN OTHERS BASED ON THEIR CARBOHYDRATE, LIPID, AND PROTEIN CONTENT. THE ENERGY VALUE OF FOOD IS TYPICALLY MEASURED IN KILOJOULES (KJ). 

CARBOHYDRATES PROVIDE APPROXIMATELY 17 KJ PER GRAM WHEN FULLY OXIDIZED. LIPIDS, WHICH ARE OFTEN A PRIMARY ENERGY SOURCE DUE TO THEIR HIGH ENERGY DENSITY, YIELD ABOUT 39 KJ PER GRAM. PROTEINS, ON AVERAGE, OFFER AROUND 18 KJ PER GRAM.

FOOD LABELS USUALLY DISPLAY THE ENERGY CONTENT ALONG WITH NUTRIENT INFORMATION (SEE FIGURE 4.11). THIS LABELING HELPS CONSUMERS UNDERSTAND THE CALORIC VALUE OF VARIOUS FOODS.

### NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION EXAMPLE: BAKED BEANS IN TOMATO SAUCE

THE NUTRITIONAL PROFILE OF BAKED BEANS IN TOMATO SAUCE INCLUDES SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CARBOHYDRATES, PROTEINS, AND FIBER. ACCORDING TO THE LABEL, EACH 100G SERVING CONTAINS ABOUT 646 KJ (155 KCAL) OF ENERGY, WITH SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM CARBOHYDRATES AND PROTEIN. THE HIGH FIBER CONTENT AIDS DIGESTION.

### ENERGY CONTENT OF COMMON FOODS

THE ENERGY CONTENT VARIES WIDELY AMONG COMMON FOODS. FOR INSTANCE, LIPID-RICH FOODS LIKE BUTTER AND NUTS HAVE HIGHER ENERGY LEVELS COMPARED TO VEGETABLES, WHICH ARE MOSTLY COMPOSED OF WATER AND THUS HAVE LOWER ENERGY CONTENT. THIS VARIATION HIGHLIGHTS THE ROLE OF MACRONUTRIENTS IN DETERMINING FOOD'S CALORIC VALUE.

FOODS WITH HIGH LIPID CONTENT TEND TO PROVIDE MORE ENERGY, WHILE THOSE RICH IN WATER, SUCH AS FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, HAVE LOWER ENERGY CONTENT. THIS UNDERSTANDING IS CRUCIAL FOR ASSESSING DIETARY NEEDS AND MAINTAINING ENERGY BALANCE.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: FOOD AND DIGESTION

## ENERGY NEEDS OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE

UNDERSTANDING THE ENERGY REQUIREMENTS OF INDIVIDUALS IS CRUCIAL FOR MAINTAINING HEALTH. DAILY ENERGY NEEDS VARY BASED ON AGE, SEX, OCCUPATION, AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. THE TABLE BELOW SUMMARIZES APPROXIMATE ENERGY NEEDS (IN KILOJOULES, KJ) FOR DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS AND OCCUPATIONS:

| AGE/SEX/OCCUPATION          | ENERGY NEEDED PER PERSON PER DAY (KJ) |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| NEWBORN BABY                | 2000                                   |
| CHILD AGED 2                | 5000                                   |
| CHILD AGED 6                | 7500                                   |
| GIRL AGED 12-14             | 9000                                   |
| BOY AGED 12-14              | 11000                                  |
| GIRL AGED 15-17             | 9000                                   |
| BOY AGED 15-17              | 12000                                  |
| FEMALE OFFICE WORKER         | 9500                                   |
| MALE OFFICE WORKER           | 10500                                  |
| HEAVY MANUAL WORKER          | 15000                                  |
| PREGNANT WOMAN              | 10000                                  |
| BREAST-FEEDING WOMAN        | 11300                                  |

ENERGY NEEDS INCREASE WITH BODY WEIGHT, AND GENERALLY, MEN REQUIRE MORE ENERGY THAN WOMEN DUE TO GREATER AVERAGE BODY MASS. PREGNANT WOMEN HAVE INCREASED ENERGY NEEDS DUE TO THE EXTRA WEIGHT THEY CARRY AND THE DEMANDS OF FETAL DEVELOPMENT. WOMEN MAY ALSO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL IRON DURING MENSTRUATION TO PREVENT ANEMIA.

## DIGESTION

DIGESTION IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH FOOD IS BROKEN DOWN INTO ITS BASIC COMPONENTS, ENABLING THE BODY TO ABSORB AND UTILIZE NUTRIENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN YOU EAT A PIECE OF BREAD, IT CONTAINS CARBOHYDRATES, LIPIDS, AND PROTEINS, WHICH MUST BE TRANSFORMED INTO SIMPLER FORMS BEFORE THEY CAN BE USED BY THE BODY.

THE DIGESTION PROCESS INVOLVES SEVERAL STEPS:

1. **BREAKING DOWN FOOD**: FOOD IS BROKEN DOWN INTO 'BUILDING BLOCKS'—SUGARS, FATTY ACIDS, GLYCEROL, AND AMINO ACIDS.
2. **ABSORPTION**: THESE DIGESTED MOLECULES ARE ABSORBED THROUGH THE WALL OF THE GUT.
3. **TRANSPORTATION**: ONCE ABSORBED, THEY ARE CARRIED AROUND THE BODY IN THE BLOOD.
4. **REASSEMBLY**: WHEN THEY REACH THE TISSUES, THEY ARE REASSEMBLED INTO THE MOLECULES THAT MAKE UP OUR CELLS.

DIGESTION IS ESSENTIAL FOR CONVERTING FOOD INTO ENERGY AND NUTRIENTS NECESSARY FOR PROPER BODILY FUNCTION. THE NUTRIENTS ABSORBED ARE VITAL FOR GROWTH, REPAIR, AND OVERALL HEALTH.

## EXTENSION WORK: MEASURING ENERGY IN FOOD

FOOD SCIENTISTS MEASURE THE ENERGY CONTENT OF FOOD USING A DEVICE CALLED A CALORIMETER. THE CALORIMETER IS FILLED WITH OXYGEN TO ENSURE THE FOOD BURNS EASILY. A HEATING FILAMENT IGNITES THE FOOD, AND THE ENERGY RELEASED FROM BURNING IS USED TO HEAT WATER FLOWING THROUGH A COIL IN THE CALORIMETER.

A FIGURE (FIGURE 4.12) ILLUSTRATES A FOOD CALORIMETER. IF YOU HAVE SAMPLES OF FOOD THAT CAN BURN IN AIR, YOU CAN MEASURE THEIR ENERGY CONTENT BY WARMING WATER IN A TEST TUBE WITH THE HEAT FROM THE BURNING FOOD.

UNDERSTANDING THE ENERGY CONTENT OF FOOD AND THE DIGESTION PROCESS IS ESSENTIAL FOR MAKING INFORMED DIETARY CHOICES AND MAINTAINING A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: FOOD AND DIGESTION

## WHAT IS DIGESTION?

DIGESTION IS DEFINED AS THE CHEMICAL AND MECHANICAL BREAKDOWN OF FOOD. THIS PROCESS CONVERTS LARGE INSOLUBLE MOLECULES INTO SMALL SOLUBLE MOLECULES THAT CAN BE ABSORBED INTO THE BLOOD.

### TYPES OF DIGESTION

MECHANICAL DIGESTION INVOLVES THE PHYSICAL BREAKDOWN OF FOOD. THE MOUTH PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE, WHERE TEETH BITE AND CHEW FOOD TO REDUCE ITS SIZE, INCREASING SURFACE AREA FOR ENZYMATIC ACTION. ADDITIONALLY, THE STOMACH'S MUSCLES CHURN FOOD DURING DIGESTION.

CHEMICAL DIGESTION RELIES ON DIGESTIVE ENZYMES PRODUCED BY THE GUT'S TISSUES AND GLANDS. THESE ENZYMES ACT ON THE FOOD WITHIN THE GUT ENVIRONMENT.

## PERISTALSIS: THE MOVEMENT OF FOOD

MUSCLES ARE ESSENTIAL FOR MOVING FOOD THROUGH THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM. THE INTESTINAL WALL CONTAINS TWO MUSCLE LAYERS:

- **CIRCULAR MUSCLE LAYER**: FIBERS ARRANGED IN RINGS AROUND THE GUT.
- **LONGITUDINAL MUSCLE LAYER**: FIBERS RUNNING ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE GUT.

### HOW PERISTALSIS WORKS

PERISTALSIS IS A WAVE-LIKE MOVEMENT FACILITATED BY THE COORDINATED CONTRACTION AND RELAXATION OF THESE MUSCLES. WHEN CIRCULAR MUSCLES CONTRACT AND LONGITUDINAL MUSCLES RELAX, THE GUT NARROWS, PUSHING FOOD FORWARD. CONVERSELY, WHEN LONGITUDINAL MUSCLES CONTRACT AND CIRCULAR MUSCLES RELAX, THE GUT WIDENS. THIS ALTERNATING ACTION PROPELS FOOD THROUGH THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM.

**FIGURE 4.13** ILLUSTRATES THIS PROCESS: THE CONTRACTION OF CIRCULAR MUSCLES BEHIND THE FOOD NARROWS THE GUT, EFFECTIVELY PUSHING THE FOOD ALONG. THIS MOVEMENT IS INDEPENDENT OF GRAVITY, ALLOWING DIGESTION TO CONTINUE REGARDLESS OF BODY POSITION.

## SUMMARY

DIGESTION COMBINES MECHANICAL AND CHEMICAL PROCESSES TO BREAK DOWN FOOD INTO ABSORBABLE MOLECULES. THE MOVEMENT OF FOOD THROUGH THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM, FACILITATED BY PERISTALSIS, ENSURES EFFICIENT DIGESTION IRRESPECTIVE OF BODY ORIENTATION.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: FOOD AND DIGESTION

## THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM

THE HUMAN DIGESTIVE SYSTEM IS A COMPLEX NETWORK OF ORGANS DESIGNED TO BREAK DOWN FOOD AND ABSORB NUTRIENTS. FIGURE 4.14 ILLUSTRATES A SIMPLIFIED DIAGRAM OF THIS SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH THE TRACT APPEARS COMPACT, IT MEASURES ABOUT 8 METERS IN LENGTH IN AN ADULT, ALLOWING SUFFICIENT TIME FOR FOOD PROCESSING AND NUTRIENT ABSORPTION AS IT TRAVELS THROUGH THE GUT.

## OVERVIEW OF THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS

THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM CONSISTS OF SEVERAL KEY ORGANS EACH PERFORMING SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS:

- **MOUTH**: SERVES AS THE ENTRY POINT FOR FOOD, INITIATING MECHANICAL AND CHEMICAL DIGESTION THROUGH CHEWING AND SALIVA PRODUCTION.
- **SALIVARY GLANDS**: SECRETION OF SALIVA, WHICH CONTAINS ENZYMES TO BEGIN BREAKING DOWN FOOD.
- **OESOPHAGUS (GULLET)**: MUSCULAR TUBE TRANSPORTING FOOD FROM THE MOUTH TO THE STOMACH.
- **STOMACH**: MUSCULAR ORGAN THAT FURTHER BREAKS DOWN FOOD USING ACIDS AND ENZYMES.
- **DUODENUM**: FIRST SEGMENT OF THE SMALL INTESTINE WHERE CHEMICAL DIGESTION PRIMARILY OCCURS.
- **ILEUM**: FINAL PART OF THE SMALL INTESTINE RESPONSIBLE FOR NUTRIENT ABSORPTION INTO THE BLOODSTREAM.
- **LARGE INTESTINE (COLON)**: ABSORBS WATER FROM INDIGESTIBLE MATTER AND COMPACTS WASTE.
- **RECTUM**: STORES WASTE BEFORE EXPULSION FROM THE BODY.
- **ANUS**: OPENING THROUGH WHICH WASTE IS ELIMINATED.
- **LIVER**: PRODUCES BILE, AIDING IN FAT DIGESTION.
- **GALL BLADDER**: STORES BILE PRODUCED BY THE LIVER.
- **PANCREAS**: RELEASES DIGESTIVE ENZYMES AND BICARBONATE TO NEUTRALIZE STOMACH ACID.

## DIGESTION PROCESS

THE PROCESS OF BREAKING DOWN FOOD INVOLVES SEVERAL SEQUENTIAL STEPS:

1. **MOUTH**: FOOD IS MECHANICALLY BROKEN DOWN BY CHEWING AND MIXED WITH SALIVA CONTAINING ENZYMES.
2. **STOMACH**: FOOD IS FURTHER BROKEN DOWN INTO A SEMI-LIQUID FORM THROUGH THE ACTION OF GASTRIC JUICES.
3. **DUODENUM**: ENZYMES FROM THE PANCREAS AND BILE FROM THE LIVER CONTINUE DIGESTION.
4. **ILEUM**: NUTRIENTS ARE ABSORBED THROUGH INTESTINAL WALLS INTO THE BLOODSTREAM.
5. **LARGE INTESTINE**: WATER IS ABSORBED, AND WASTE IS PREPARED FOR ELIMINATION.

THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM IS CRUCIAL FOR CONVERTING FOOD INTO ENERGY AND NUTRIENTS ESSENTIAL FOR BODILY FUNCTION. UNDERSTANDING EACH COMPONENT'S ROLE HIGHLIGHTS THE COMPLEXITY OF HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: FOOD AND DIGESTION

## OVERVIEW OF DIGESTION

DIGESTION IS A COMPLEX PROCESS THAT BREAKS DOWN FOOD INTO SMALLER, ABSORBABLE COMPONENTS. THE THREE MAIN CLASSES OF FOOD—CARBOHYDRATES, PROTEINS, AND LIPIDS—ARE EACH DIGESTED BY SPECIFIC ENZYMES:

- **CARBOHYDRASES** BREAK DOWN CARBOHYDRATES.
- **PROTEASES** ACT ON PROTEINS.
- **LIPASES** ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR LIPID BREAKDOWN.

### KEY POINTS

DIGESTION BEGINS IN THE MOUTH WHERE SALIVA MOISTENS FOOD AND CONTAINS THE ENZYME AMYLASE, WHICH STARTS STARCH BREAKDOWN. THE MIXTURE THEN PASSES THROUGH THE ESOPHAGUS TO THE STOMACH.

### ENZYMES IN THE HUMAN GUT

THE HUMAN GUT CONTAINS VARIOUS ENZYMES THAT FACILITATE DIGESTION:

- **CARBOHYDRASES** LIKE AMYLASE BREAK DOWN STARCH INTO MALTOSE.
- **MALTASE** FURTHER CONVERTS MALTOSE INTO GLUCOSE.
- **PROTEASES**, SUCH AS PEPSIN, BREAK PROTEINS INTO PEPTIDES.
- **PEPTIDASES** THEN BREAK THESE PEPTIDES INTO AMINO ACIDS.
- **LIPASES** SPLIT LIPIDS INTO GLYCEROL AND FATTY ACIDS.

### THE STOMACH'S ROLE IN DIGESTION

THE STOMACH HOLDS FOOD FOR SEVERAL HOURS, DURING WHICH PROTEASE ENZYMES LIKE PEPSIN DIGEST PROTEINS. THE STOMACH SECRETES HYDROCHLORIC ACID, CREATING AN ACIDIC ENVIRONMENT THAT KILLS BACTERIA AND AIDS DIGESTION.

### SPHINCTER MUSCLE AND THE DUODENUM

A SPHINCTER MUSCLE AT THE STOMACH'S OUTLET CONTROLS THE RELEASE OF SEMI-DIGESTED FOOD INTO THE DUODENUM, THE SMALL INTESTINE'S FIRST SEGMENT. THE DUODENUM RECEIVES DIGESTIVE JUICES FROM THE LIVER AND PANCREAS VIA DUCTS.

*NOTE: MALTOSE IS A DISACCHARIDE COMPOSED OF TWO GLUCOSE MOLECULES. PEPTIDES ARE SHORT CHAINS OF AMINO ACIDS.*

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: FOOD AND DIGESTION

## FOOD AND DIGESTION

THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION BEGINS IN THE DUODENUM WITH THE ADDITION OF DIGESTIVE ENZYMES PRODUCED BY THE PANCREAS. THESE ENZYMES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR BREAKING DOWN STARCHES, PROTEINS, AND LIPIDS. ADDITIONALLY, THE LIVER PRODUCES A DIGESTIVE JUICE CALLED BILE, WHICH IS STORED IN THE GALL BLADDER AND RELEASED INTO THE DUODENUM VIA THE BILE DUCT.

### BILE AND ITS FUNCTIONS

BILE IS A GREEN LIQUID THAT PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN DIGESTION DESPITE NOT CONTAINING ENZYMES. IT EMULSIFIES LARGE LIPID GLOBULES INTO TINY DROPLETS (AS SEEN IN FIGURE 4.16), INCREASING THEIR SURFACE AREA AND MAKING IT EASIER FOR LIPASE ENZYMES TO BREAK THEM DOWN. THIS PROCESS FACILITATES THE EFFICIENT DIGESTION OF FATS.

BILE, ALONG WITH PANCREATIC JUICE, CREATES AN ALKALINE ENVIRONMENT IN THE DUODENUM. THIS NEUTRALIZES THE ACIDIC MIXTURE OF SEMI-DIGESTED FOOD AND STOMACH ENZYMES, ALLOWING THE DIGESTIVE PROCESS TO CONTINUE SMOOTHLY AS FOOD MOVES THROUGH THE GUT.

AS FOOD PROGRESSES ALONG THE INTESTINE, MORE ENZYMES ARE ADDED UNTIL ALL DIGESTIBLE COMPONENTS ARE FULLY BROKEN DOWN INTO SOLUBLE END PRODUCTS. THESE PRODUCTS ARE PRIMARILY ABSORBED IN THE LAST PART OF THE SMALL INTESTINE, KNOWN AS THE ILEUM.

## ABSORPTION IN THE ILEUM

THE ILEUM IS SPECIALIZED FOR THE ABSORPTION OF DIGESTED FOOD. ITS LINING IS DESIGNED TO EFFICIENTLY ABSORB SOLUBLE PRODUCTS INTO THE BLOODSTREAM. THE LENGTH AND FOLDS OF THE INTESTINE CONTRIBUTE TO A LARGE SURFACE AREA, WHICH IS FURTHER ENHANCED BY TINY PROJECTIONS CALLED VILLI (AS SEEN IN FIGURE 4.17).

### STRUCTURE OF VILLI

EACH VILLUS MEASURES ABOUT 1-2 MM IN LENGTH AND COVERS AN EXTENSIVE SURFACE AREA OF APPROXIMATELY 300 M². THE SURFACE CELLS OF EACH VILLUS ARE COVERED WITH EVEN SMALLER PROJECTIONS CALLED MICROVILLI, WHICH FURTHER INCREASE THE ABSORPTION AREA (AS SEEN IN FIGURE 4.18). THESE MICROVILLI ARE REVEALED THROUGH HIGH-POWERED MICROSCOPY.

EACH VILLUS CONTAINS A NETWORK OF BLOOD CAPILLARIES WHERE MOST DIGESTED FOOD ENTERS THE BLOODSTREAM. HOWEVER, THE PRODUCTS OF FAT DIGESTION, ALONG WITH TINY FAT DROPLETS, ENTER A CENTRAL TUBE CALLED A LACTEAL. THE LACTEALS ARE PART OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM, WHICH TRANSPORTS A FLUID CALLED LYMPH INTO THE BLOODSTREAM.

IN SUMMARY, THE STRUCTURE OF THE ILEUM AND THE ROLES OF BILE AND PANCREATIC JUICES ARE ESSENTIAL FOR EFFECTIVELY DIGESTING AND ABSORBING NUTRIENTS IN THE BODY.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY

## KEY POINT
THE REMOVAL OF FECES BY THE BODY IS SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS EXCRETION. HOWEVER, EXCRETION SPECIFICALLY PERTAINS TO WASTE PRODUCTS GENERATED AT THE CELLULAR LEVEL, SUCH AS CARBON DIOXIDE. IN CONTRAST, FECES ARE WASTE MATERIALS THAT PASS THROUGH THE GUT AND EXIT THE BODY VIA THE ANUS WITHOUT ENTERING CELLS. THE CORRECT TERM FOR THIS PROCESS IS **EGESTION**.

## FOOD AND DIGESTION

### STRUCTURE OF THE VILLUS
EACH VILLUS IN THE ILEUM CONTAINS BLOOD VESSELS AND A LACTEAL, WHICH ABSORB DIGESTION PRODUCTS. THE SURFACE OF THE VILLUS IS COVERED WITH MICROVILLI, SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING THE ABSORPTION AREA. 

- THE VILLUS EPITHELIUM CONSISTS OF A SINGLE LAYER OF CELLS, MINIMIZING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN DIGESTED FOOD IN THE ILEUM AND BLOOD CAPILLARIES FOR EFFICIENT DIFFUSION.
- EPITHELIAL CELLS ARE RICH IN MITOCHONDRIA, PROVIDING ENERGY FOR ACTIVE TRANSPORT OF CERTAIN SUBSTANCES.
- VILLI CONTAIN MUSCLE FIBERS THAT CONTRACT TO MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH GUT CONTENTS, PRESERVING A STEEP CONCENTRATION GRADIENT FOR DIFFUSION.

### BLOOD CIRCULATION
BLOOD VESSELS FROM THE ILEUM CONVERGE INTO THE HEPATIC PORTAL VEIN, TRANSPORTING ABSORBED NUTRIENTS TO THE LIVER. THE LIVER PROCESSES THESE NUTRIENTS, CONVERTING GLUCOSE INTO GLYCOGEN FOR STORAGE AND LATER USE AS NEEDED. SOLUBLE FOOD MOLECULES ARE ASSIMILATED INTO CELLS THROUGH ABSORPTION.

## THE LARGE INTESTINE: ELIMINATION OF WASTE
BY THE TIME GUT CONTENTS REACH THE END OF THE SMALL INTESTINE, MOST DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION HAVE OCCURRED. REMAINING WASTE INCLUDES CELLULOSE, INDIGESTIBLE MATTER, WATER, BACTERIA, AND SHED GUT LINING CELLS.

THE COLON ABSORBS REMAINING WATER, FORMING SEMI-SOLID FECES STORED IN THE RECTUM UNTIL EXPULSION THROUGH THE ANUS.

## CHAPTER QUESTIONS

### CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS
WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING ORGANIC MOLECULES CONTAINS CARBON, HYDROGEN, OXYGEN, AND NITROGEN? PROTEINS ARE COMPOSED OF AMINO ACIDS, WHICH INCLUDE CARBON, HYDROGEN, OXYGEN, AND NITROGEN. WHILE OTHER MOLECULES LIKE GLYCOGEN, LIPIDS, AND CELLULOSE ALSO CONTAIN SOME OF THESE ELEMENTS, PROTEINS UNIQUELY HAVE ALL FOUR IN THEIR STRUCTURE.

### EXECUTIVE FUNCTION SKILLS
THE EXPERIMENT DEMONSTRATES THE NECESSITY OF DIGESTION THROUGH A MODEL OF THE SMALL INTESTINE USING VISKING TUBING. THE SETUP INVOLVES PLACING THE TUBING IN BOILING WATER TO SIMULATE DIGESTION OVER AN HOUR. TESTING FOR STARCH REQUIRES IODINE SOLUTION, WHICH TURNS BLUE IF STARCH IS PRESENT. FOR GLUCOSE, BENEDICT'S SOLUTION CHANGES COLOR FROM ORANGE TO YELLOW UPON DETECTION.

### REASONING SKILLS
THE PRESENCE OF GLUCOSE BUT ABSENCE OF STARCH INDICATES THAT DIGESTION HAS OCCURRED. THE SMALL INTESTINE EFFECTIVELY BREAKS DOWN STARCH INTO GLUCOSE, MAKING IT ABSORBABLE BY THE BLOODSTREAM. THIS PROCESS HIGHLIGHTS THE ROLE OF DIGESTIVE ENZYMES IN TRANSFORMING COMPLEX MOLECULES INTO SIMPLER ONES FOR UTILIZATION.

### CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS
'DIGESTED' REFERS TO THE BREAKDOWN OF FOOD INTO SMALLER, ABSORBABLE COMPONENTS THROUGH ENZYMATIC ACTION IN THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM, ENABLING NUTRIENTS LIKE GLUCOSE AND AMINO ACIDS TO BE ABSORBED INTO THE BLOODSTREAM.

# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: FOOD AND DIGESTION

## INTRODUCTION TO DIGESTION
DIGESTION IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH FOOD IS BROKEN DOWN INTO SMALLER COMPONENTS THAT CAN BE ABSORBED. THIS BREAKDOWN INVOLVES VARIOUS ENZYMES ACTING ON DIFFERENT TYPES OF FOOD.

### EXPERIMENT ON PEPSIN AND PROTEIN DIGESTION
A STUDENT CONDUCTED AN EXPERIMENT TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL CONDITIONS FOR PEPSIN, AN ENZYME THAT DIGESTS PROTEIN. THE EXPERIMENT USED EGG WHITE POWDER, WHICH FORMS A CLOUDY SUSPENSION WHEN MIXED WITH WATER. FOUR TUBES WERE SET UP AS FOLLOWS:

- **TUBE A**: 5 CM³ EGG WHITE SUSPENSION + 2 CM³ PEPSIN + 3 DROPS DILUTE ACID (37°C)
- **TUBE B**: 5 CM³ EGG WHITE SUSPENSION + 2 CM³ DISTILLED WATER + 3 DROPS DILUTE ACID (37°C)
- **TUBE C**: 5 CM³ EGG WHITE SUSPENSION + 2 CM³ PEPSIN + 3 DROPS DILUTE ACID (20°C)
- **TUBE D**: 5 CM³ EGG WHITE SUSPENSION + 2 CM³ PEPSIN + 3 DROPS DILUTE ALKALI (37°C)

AFTER 2 HOURS, THE RESULTS SHOWED:
- TUBE A CLEARED.
- TUBES B AND D REMAINED CLOUDY.
- TUBE C CLEARED AFTER AN ADDITIONAL 3 HOURS.

### QUESTIONS AND EXPLANATIONS
1. **WHY WAS 37°C CHOSEN?**  
   37°C IS THE AVERAGE BODY TEMPERATURE, OPTIMAL FOR ENZYME ACTIVITY.

2. **WHAT HAPPENED IN TUBE A?**  
   PEPSIN DIGESTED PROTEIN INTO SMALLER PEPTIDES, MAKING THE SOLUTION CLEAR.

3. **WHY DID TUBE D STAY CLOUDY?**  
   DILUTE ALKALI INHIBITED PEPSIN ACTIVITY, PREVENTING DIGESTION.

4. **WHAT IS TUBE B'S ROLE?**  
   TUBE B SERVES AS A CONTROL TO COMPARE WITH EXPERIMENTAL TUBES AND OBSERVE PEPSIN'S EFFECT.

5. **WHY SLOWER DIGESTION IN TUBE C?**  
   LOWER TEMPERATURE (20°C) SLOWED ENZYME ACTIVITY.

6. **HYDROCHLORIC ACID'S FUNCTION?**  
   IT CREATES AN ACIDIC ENVIRONMENT ACTIVATING PEPSIN AND BREAKING DOWN FOOD.

7. **NEUTRALIZATION IN THE DUODENUM?**  
   BICARBONATE IONS NEUTRALIZE STOMACH CONTENTS, FACILITATING DIGESTION.

### DIGESTIVE ENZYMES
THE FOLLOWING ENZYMES ACT ON SPECIFIC FOODS:

- **AMYLASE**: BREAKS DOWN STARCH INTO MALTOSE.
- **TRYPSIN**: DIGESTS PROTEIN INTO PEPTIDES.
- **LIPASE**: CONVERTS LIPIDS INTO FATTY ACIDS AND GLYCEROL.

### SMALL INTESTINE ADAPTATIONS
THE ILEUM'S ADAPTATIONS ENHANCE NUTRIENT ABSORPTION:
1. **LARGE SURFACE AREA**: VILLI AND MICROVILLI INCREASE ABSORPTION CAPACITY.
2. **THIN WALLS**: FACILITATE EASY DIFFUSION OF NUTRIENTS.
3. **RICH BLOOD SUPPLY**: ENSURES QUICK TRANSPORT OF ABSORBED NUTRIENTS.
4. **MUSCULAR WALLS**: AID FOOD MOVEMENT AND MIXING.

### BREAD'S JOURNEY THROUGH THE GUT
BREAD, COMPOSED MAINLY OF STARCH, PROTEIN, AND LIPIDS, UNDERGOES SEVERAL TRANSFORMATIONS:

1. **MOUTH**: CHEWING BREAKS BREAD INTO PIECES; SALIVA'S AMYLASE BEGINS STARCH DIGESTION.
2. **STOMACH**: PEPSIN DIGESTS PROTEINS IN GASTRIC JUICES.
3. **DUODENUM**: NEUTRALIZED CHYME IS MIXED WITH BILE AND PANCREATIC JUICES, FURTHER DIGESTING FATS AND CARBOHYDRATES.
4. **ILEUM**: NUTRIENTS ARE ABSORBED INTO THE BLOODSTREAM VIA CAPILLARIES.
5. **COLON**: WATER IS REABSORBED; REMAINING WASTE IS PREPARED FOR EXCRETION.

### DIAGRAMS
SIMPLIFIED DIAGRAMS ILLUSTRATE BREAD'S JOURNEY THROUGH THE MOUTH, STOMACH, DUODENUM, ILEUM, AND COLON.

BY UNDERSTANDING THESE PROCESSES, WE APPRECIATE HOW EFFICIENTLY NUTRIENTS ARE EXTRACTED FROM FOOD.
