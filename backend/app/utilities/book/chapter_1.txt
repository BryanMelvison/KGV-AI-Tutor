# BIOLOGY UNIT 1: ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES

## INTRODUCTION TO LIFE PROCESSES

ALL LIVING ORGANISMS ARE COMPOSED OF MICROSCOPIC UNITS CALLED **CELLS**. THESE BUILDING BLOCKS OF LIFE SHARE SEVERAL COMMON FEATURES THAT ENABLE THEM TO GROW, REPRODUCE, AND CARRY OUT ESSENTIAL LIFE PROCESSES.

### KEY FEATURES OF CELLS
CELLS POSSESS THE ABILITY TO GROW IN SIZE AND INCREASE IN NUMBER. THIS GROWTH IS FUNDAMENTAL FOR DEVELOPMENT AND REPRODUCTION. ADDITIONALLY, CELLS PERFORM VITAL FUNCTIONS NECESSARY FOR SUSTAINING LIFE, ENSURING THE CONTINUITY OF BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES.

DESPITE THE STRUCTURAL SIMILARITIES AMONG CELLS, THERE IS A REMARKABLE DIVERSITY AMONG ORGANISMS. THIS UNIT EXPLORES THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF CELLS AS WELL AS THE CLASSIFICATION OF DIFFERENT ORGANISMS BASED ON THEIR CHARACTERISTICS.

## THE DIVERSITY OF LIVING ORGANISMS

THE EARTH IS HOME TO MILLIONS OF SPECIES, EACH WITH UNIQUE FEATURES THAT ALLOW THEM TO THRIVE IN VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTS. UNDERSTANDING THIS BIODIVERSITY IS CRUCIAL FOR STUDYING BIOLOGY AND APPRECIATING THE COMPLEXITY OF LIFE ON EARTH.

### CLASSIFICATION OF ORGANISMS
ORGANISMS ARE CLASSIFIED INTO GROUPS BASED ON SHARED CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS STRUCTURE, FUNCTION, AND GENETIC MAKEUP. THIS SYSTEM OF CLASSIFICATION AIDS SCIENTISTS IN COMMUNICATING ABOUT DIFFERENT SPECIES AND UNDERSTANDING THEIR RELATIONSHIPS.

# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES

## LIFE PROCESSES

### INTRODUCTION
ALL LIVING ORGANISMS ARE COMPOSED OF UNITS CALLED CELLS. THE SIMPLEST ORGANISMS, SUCH AS BACTERIA, FUNGI, AND PROTOZOA, CONSIST OF SINGLE CELLS. MULTICELLULAR PLANTS AND ANIMALS, HOWEVER, ARE MADE UP OF MILLIONS OF SPECIALIZED CELLS. THESE CELLS DIFFER IN STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION, ENABLING THEM TO PERFORM SPECIFIC ROLES WITHIN THE ORGANISM.

### LEARNING OBJECTIVES
UNDERSTANDING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF LIVING ORGANISMS AND THEIR CELL STRUCTURES IS FUNDAMENTAL. THIS INCLUDES RECOGNIZING THE NUCLEUS, CYTOPLASM, CELL MEMBRANE, CELL WALL, MITOCHONDRIA, CHLOROPLASTS, RIBOSOMES, AND VACUOLE AS ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PLANT AND ANIMAL CELLS, THE ROLE OF ENZYMES IN METABOLIC REACTIONS, AND HOW TEMPERATURE AND PH AFFECT ENZYME FUNCTION ARE KEY AREAS TO EXPLORE.

### KEY CONCEPTS

#### CELLS
CELLS SERVE AS THE BASIC UNIT OF LIFE, WITH ALL LIVING ORGANISMS COMPOSED OF ONE OR MORE CELLS. THESE CELLS VARY IN STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION, ALLOWING FOR SPECIALIZED ROLES WITHIN MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS.

#### SPECIALIZATION
IN MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS, DIFFERENT TYPES OF CELLS EXIST, EACH WITH UNIQUE STRUCTURES THAT ENABLE THEM TO PERFORM SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS. THIS SPECIALIZATION IS CRUCIAL FOR THE SURVIVAL AND COMPLEXITY OF SUCH ORGANISMS.

#### ENZYMES
ENZYMES ACT AS BIOLOGICAL CATALYSTS, ACCELERATING METABOLIC REACTIONS. THEIR ACTIVITY CAN BE INFLUENCED BY TEMPERATURE AND PH, WHICH AFFECT THEIR SHAPE AND FUNCTION.

#### RESPIRATION
RESPIRATION IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH ORGANISMS CONVERT FOOD INTO ENERGY. THIS OCCURS THROUGH AEROBIC OR ANAEROBIC PATHWAYS, WITH AEROBIC RESPIRATION INVOLVING THE BREAKDOWN OF GLUCOSE IN MITOCHONDRIA TO PRODUCE ATP, WHILE ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION FUNCTIONS WITHOUT OXYGEN, PRODUCING LACTIC ACID OR ETHANOL AS BYPRODUCTS.

### VISUAL REFERENCE
THE FIGURE PROVIDED ILLUSTRATES EXAMPLES OF SIMPLE ORGANISMS COMPOSED OF SINGLE CELLS, SUCH AS BACTERIA AND PROTOZOA. THIS VISUAL AIDS IN UNDERSTANDING THE FUNDAMENTAL ORGANIZATION OF LIFE AT THE CELLULAR LEVEL.

# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES

LIVING ORGANISMS EXHIBIT EIGHT ESSENTIAL LIFE PROCESSES. THESE PROCESSES ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO THE FUNCTIONING OF ALL LIVING CREATURES.

**NUTRITION**: PLANTS PRODUCE THEIR OWN FOOD THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS, WHILE ANIMALS OBTAIN ENERGY BY CONSUMING OTHER ORGANISMS.

**RESPIRATION**: ORGANISMS RELEASE ENERGY FROM THEIR FOOD THROUGH A PROCESS THAT CONVERTS CHEMICAL ENERGY INTO ATP.

**EXCRETION**: THE ELIMINATION OF WASTE PRODUCTS IS CRUCIAL FOR MAINTAINING INTERNAL STABILITY IN ORGANISMS.

**RESPONSE TO STIMULI**: ORGANISMS DETECT AND REACT TO CHANGES IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT, ENSURING SURVIVAL AND ADAPTATION.

**MOVEMENT**: ANIMALS MOVE USING MUSCLES, WHILE PLANTS EXHIBIT SLOW GROWTH MOVEMENTS THROUGH ELONGATION OF CELLS.

**CONTROL OF INTERNAL CONDITIONS**: ORGANISMS MAINTAIN A STABLE INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT THROUGH HOMEOSTATIC MECHANISMS.

**REPRODUCTION**: THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE OFFSPRING IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE CONTINUATION OF SPECIES.

**GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT**: ORGANISMS INCREASE IN SIZE AND COMPLEXITY BY UTILIZING MATERIALS FROM THEIR FOOD, FOLLOWING SPECIFIC GROWTH PATTERNS DETERMINED BY GENETICS AND ENVIRONMENT.

# CELL STRUCTURE

THIS SECTION EXPLORES THE STRUCTURE OF CELLS IN HIGHER ORGANISMS, INCLUDING ANIMALS, PLANTS, AND FUNGI. BACTERIAL CELLS, WHICH HAVE A SIMPLER STRUCTURE, ARE DISCUSSED IN ANOTHER CHAPTER.

### KEY COMPONENTS OF CELLS

MOST CELLS CONTAIN SEVERAL ESSENTIAL PARTS, INCLUDING:

- **NUCLEUS**: THE CONTROL CENTER OF THE CELL.
- **CYTOPLASM**: THE LIVING MATERIAL THAT CONSTITUTES A CELL, COMPOSED OF VARIOUS ORGANELLES.
- **CELL MEMBRANE**: THE SEMI-PERMEABLE MEMBRANE ENCLOSING THE CELL.

SOME CELLS MAY LACK CERTAIN STRUCTURES. FOR EXAMPLE, RED BLOOD CELLS DO NOT HAVE A NUCLEUS, WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO CARRY MORE OXYGEN IN THEIR HEMOGLOBIN.

### TYPICAL CELL DIAGRAMS

BIOLOGY TEXTBOOKS OFTEN PRESENT DIAGRAMS OF 'TYPICAL' PLANT AND ANIMAL CELLS. HOWEVER, NO SINGLE CELL IS TRULY TYPICAL, AS HUMANS ALONE HAVE HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT CELL TYPES. THE TERM 'TYPICAL' REFERS TO GENERAL ILLUSTRATIONS THAT HIGHLIGHT COMMON FEATURES FOUND IN MOST CELLS. THESE DIAGRAMS MAY INCLUDE STRUCTURES LIKE MITOCHONDRIA IN ANIMALS OR CHLOROPLASTS IN PLANTS, EVEN IF NOT ALL CELLS POSSESS EVERY FEATURE.

### COMPARISON OF ANIMAL AND PLANT CELLS

ANIMAL CELLS CONTAIN:

- NUCLEUS
- CELL MEMBRANE
- CYTOPLASM
- MITOCHONDRIA

PLANT CELLS, IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE, HAVE:

- CELL WALL
- VACUOLE

THE PRESENCE OF THESE STRUCTURES HIGHLIGHTS DIFFERENCES IN HOW PLANTS AND ANIMALS FUNCTION. THIS COMPARISON UNDERSCORES THE DIVERSITY OF CELL STRUCTURES AMONG ORGANISMS, EMPHASIZING THAT EACH TYPE OF CELL SERVES SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS TAILORED TO ITS ORGANISM'S NEEDS.

# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES

## LIFE PROCESSES

### THE CELL AND ITS ORGANELLES

THE CELL CONTAINS SEVERAL ESSENTIAL ORGANELLES THAT PLAY CRUCIAL ROLES IN ITS FUNCTIONS. THE NUCLEUS, THE LARGEST ORGANELLE, SERVES AS THE CONTROL CENTER OF THE CELL, HOUSING CHROMOSOMES (46 IN HUMAN CELLS) THAT CARRY GENETIC INFORMATION. DNA, WHICH HOLDS THESE GENES, REMAINS WITHIN THE NUCLEUS BUT DIRECTS PROTEIN SYNTHESIS IN THE CYTOPLASM THROUGH RIBOSOMES, THOUSANDS OF WHICH ARE PRESENT BUT TOO SMALL TO BE SEEN UNDER A LIGHT MICROSCOPE. ENZYMES, VITAL FOR CATALYZING CHEMICAL REACTIONS, ALSO RESIDE IN THE CYTOPLASM.

THE CELL MEMBRANE ACTS AS A PROTECTIVE BARRIER, SELECTIVELY ALLOWING SUBSTANCES TO ENTER OR EXIT THE CYTOPLASM. THIS SEMI-PERMEABLE MEMBRANE IS CRUCIAL FOR MAINTAINING CELLULAR INTEGRITY AND REGULATING INTERACTIONS WITH THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT.

MITOCHONDRIA, LOCATED IN THE CYTOPLASM, ARE ESSENTIAL FOR ENERGY PRODUCTION, PARTICULARLY IN CELLS REQUIRING HIGH ENERGY, SUCH AS MUSCLE AND NERVE CELLS. THESE ORGANELLES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FINAL STAGES OF RESPIRATION, RELEASING ENERGY THAT THE CELL CAN UTILIZE.

### CELL MEMBRANE

THE CELL MEMBRANE IS A THIN, FLEXIBLE STRUCTURE SURROUNDING THE CYTOPLASM, SERVING AS A BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE CELL'S INTERIOR AND ITS ENVIRONMENT. IT IS PARTIALLY PERMEABLE, ALLOWING CERTAIN SUBSTANCES TO PASS IN OR OUT WHILE CONTROLLING OTHERS, THUS REGULATING THE CELL'S CHEMICAL COMPOSITION.

### MITOCHONDRIA

MITOCHONDRIA ARE SPECIALIZED ORGANELLES FOUND IN ALL LIVING CELLS. THEY ARE PARTICULARLY NUMEROUS IN CELLS WITH HIGH ENERGY DEMANDS, SUCH AS THOSE IN MUSCLE AND NERVE TISSUES. THESE STRUCTURES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PRODUCTION OF ATP, THE CELL'S PRIMARY ENERGY CURRENCY, THROUGH THE PROCESS OF CELLULAR RESPIRATION. MOST OF THE ENERGY GENERATED DURING RESPIRATION IS RELEASED WITHIN MITOCHONDRIA.

## PLANT CELLS

PLANT CELLS POSSESS UNIQUE STRUCTURAL FEATURES THAT DISTINGUISH THEM FROM ANIMAL CELLS. AMONG THESE ARE:

### CELL WALL

THE CELL WALL IS A RIGID, NON-LIVING LAYER ENCLOSING PLANT CELLS, PROVIDING STRUCTURAL SUPPORT AND PREVENTING EXCESSIVE EXPANSION. COMPOSED PRIMARILY OF CELLULOSE, IT MAINTAINS THE CELL'S SHAPE AND CONTRIBUTES TO THE RIGIDITY OF PLANT TISSUES. UNLIKE ANIMAL CELLS, WHICH ARE MORE VARIABLE IN FORM, PLANT CELLS HAVE A DEFINED STRUCTURE DUE TO THEIR CELL WALLS.

### PERMANENT VACUOLE

IN MATURE PLANT CELLS, A LARGE CENTRAL VACUOLE IS PRESENT, SURROUNDED BY A MEMBRANE. THIS VACUOLE CONTAINS CELL SAP, A SOLUTION RICH IN DISSOLVED SUGARS AND MINERALS. UNLIKE THE TEMPORARY VACUOLES FOUND IN ANIMAL CELLS, THIS STRUCTURE IS PERMANENT AND PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN STORING METABOLIC PRODUCTS.

### CHLOROPLASTS

CHLOROPLASTS ARE UNIQUE TO PLANT CELLS AND ARE ESSENTIAL FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS. THESE ORGANELLES CONTAIN CHLOROPHYLL, THE PIGMENT NECESSARY FOR ABSORBING LIGHT ENERGY, WHICH IS THEN CONVERTED INTO CHEMICAL ENERGY THROUGH PHOTOPHOSPHORYLATION. THIS PROCESS ENABLES PLANTS TO SYNTHESIZE THEIR OWN FOOD IN AREAS LIKE LEAVES, WHERE THESE STRUCTURES ARE MOST ABUNDANT.

### KEY POINT

ALL CELLS SHARE FUNDAMENTAL ORGANELLES SUCH AS CYTOPLASM, NUCLEUS, CELL MEMBRANE, AND MITOCHONDRIA. PLANT CELLS FURTHER DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES WITH A CELL WALL, PERMANENT VACUOLE, AND CHLOROPLASTS. THE PRESENCE OF CHLOROPLASTS SPECIFICALLY IN PLANT CELLS ENABLES PHOTOSYNTHESIS, A PROCESS CRUCIAL FOR THEIR SURVIVAL IN ENVIRONMENTS WHERE SUNLIGHT IS AVAILABLE.

### CELLS UNDER THE MICROSCOPE
THE FIGURE ILLUSTRATES ANIMAL AND PLANT CELLS OBSERVED UNDER A LIGHT MICROSCOPE. THE HUMAN CHEEK LINING CELLS MEASURE 10 ΜM, WHILE LEAF PHOTOSYNTHETIC TISSUE CELLS ARE LARGER AT 25 ΜM.

---

## ENZYMES: CONTROLLING REACTIONS IN THE CELL

### KEY POINT
METABOLIC REACTIONS WITHIN A CELL INVOLVE CHEMICAL PROCESSES REGULATED BY ENZYMES. THE COLLECTIVE TERM FOR THESE REACTIONS IS CELLULAR METABOLISM.

### WHAT ARE ENZYMES?
ENZYMES ARE BIOLOGICAL CATALYSTS, PROTEINS THAT ACCELERATE SPECIFIC CHEMICAL REACTIONS WITHOUT BEING CONSUMED. EACH ENZYME CATALYZES A UNIQUE REACTION, ENABLING PRECISE CONTROL OF CELLULAR ACTIVITIES. THESE ENZYMES ARE PRODUCED IN THE NUCLEUS THROUGH GENE REGULATION AND FUNCTION PRIMARILY IN THE CYTOPLASM.

### ENZYME PRODUCTION
GENES DICTATE THE PRODUCTION OF ENZYMES, WHICH THEN CATALYZE REACTIONS ESSENTIAL FOR CELL FUNCTIONS. THE SPECIFIC ENZYMES A CELL PRODUCES DETERMINE ITS METABOLIC CAPABILITIES.

### WHY ARE ENZYMES NECESSARY?
ENZYMES FACILITATE RAPID CHEMICAL REACTIONS AT BODY TEMPERATURES, ENABLING ESSENTIAL CELLULAR PROCESSES TO FUNCTION EFFICIENTLY AND SUSTAIN LIFE.

### INTRACELLULAR VS. EXTRACELLULAR ENZYMES
- **EXTRACELLULAR ENZYMES**: FOUND IN THE INTESTINE, THEY AID IN FOOD DIGESTION.
- **INTRACELLULAR ENZYMES**: PERFORM FUNCTIONS WITHIN CELLS, CONTRIBUTING TO VARIOUS BIOCHEMICAL PROCESSES.

# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES

## LIFE PROCESSES

ENZYMES ARE BIOLOGICAL CATALYSTS THAT SPEED UP CHEMICAL REACTIONS IN LIVING ORGANISMS. THESE MOLECULES, KNOWN AS SUBSTRATES, INTERACT WITH A SPECIFIC AREA ON THE ENZYME CALLED THE ACTIVE SITE. THIS INTERACTION ALLOWS REACTIONS TO PROCEED MORE EFFICIENTLY, FACILITATING THE FORMATION OF PRODUCTS.

THE LOCK AND KEY MODEL EXPLAINS THIS SPECIFICITY. AN ENZYME'S ACTIVE SITE IS LIKE A LOCK, WHILE THE SUBSTRATE FITS INTO IT LIKE A KEY. THIS ENSURES THAT EACH ENZYME REACTS ONLY WITH ITS UNIQUE SUBSTRATE, CATALYZING SPECIFIC REACTIONS WITHOUT INTERFERING WITH OTHERS.

AFTER THE REACTION OCCURS, THE PRODUCT IS RELEASED FROM THE ACTIVE SITE, ALLOWING THE ENZYME TO CONTINUE CATALYZING FURTHER REACTIONS WITH ADDITIONAL SUBSTRATE MOLECULES.

## FACTORS AFFECTING ENZYMES

SEVERAL FACTORS INFLUENCE ENZYME ACTIVITY:

1. **CONCENTRATION OF ENZYME AND SUBSTRATE**: INCREASING EITHER CAN ENHANCE REACTION RATES.
2. **TEMPERATURE**: HUMAN ENZYMES FUNCTION OPTIMALLY AT BODY TEMPERATURE (37°C).

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TEMPERATURE AND ENZYME ACTIVITY PEAKS AT THE OPTIMAL TEMPERATURE, AS HIGHER TEMPERATURES INCREASE MOLECULAR KINETIC ENERGY, LEADING TO MORE FREQUENT COLLISIONS AND REACTIONS.

UNDERSTANDING ENZYME BEHAVIOR IS CRUCIAL FOR STUDYING BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES.

# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES

## LIFE PROCESSES

### ENZYMES AND THEIR FUNCTION

ENZYMES ARE CRUCIAL BIOLOGICAL CATALYSTS THAT ACCELERATE CHEMICAL REACTIONS IN LIVING ORGANISMS. THEY PRIMARILY CONSIST OF PROTEINS AND THEIR ACTIVITY IS INFLUENCED BY FACTORS SUCH AS TEMPERATURE AND PH.

#### EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON ENZYME ACTIVITY

EACH ENZYME HAS AN OPTIMAL TEMPERATURE AT WHICH IT FUNCTIONS MOST EFFECTIVELY. FOR MANY ENZYMES IN MAMMALS AND BIRDS, THIS OPTIMAL TEMPERATURE IS APPROXIMATELY 37°C, ALIGNING WITH THE BODY'S NORMAL TEMPERATURE.

DENATURATION OCCURS WHEN TEMPERATURES EXCEED THE OPTIMAL LEVEL, CAUSING THE PROTEIN STRUCTURE OF THE ENZYME TO UNRAVEL. THIS STRUCTURAL CHANGE ALTERS THE ACTIVE SITE, PREVENTING THE SUBSTRATE FROM BINDING CORRECTLY. DENATURATION IS IRREVERSIBLE, LEADING TO A LOSS OF ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY.

AN ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE IS BOILING AN EGG, WHERE THE PROTEIN IN THE EGG WHITE DENATURES, TRANSFORMING IT FROM A LIQUID TO A SOLID.

#### EFFECT OF PH ON ENZYME ACTIVITY

THE PH LEVEL SURROUNDING AN ENZYME SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTS ITS FUNCTIONALITY. MOST ENZYMES OPERATE BEST AT A NEUTRAL PH (AROUND 7), REFERRED TO AS THEIR OPTIMUM PH.

EXCESSIVE ALKALINITY OR ACIDITY CAN IMPAIR ENZYME STRUCTURE AND ACTIVITY. FOR INSTANCE, EXTREME PH LEVELS DISRUPT THE ACTIVE SITE'S SHAPE, HINDERING SUBSTRATE BINDING.

SOME ENZYMES, HOWEVER, ARE ADAPTED TO FUNCTION IN SPECIFIC CONDITIONS. PEPSIN, FOUND IN THE STOMACH, THRIVES IN ACIDIC ENVIRONMENTS WITH AN OPTIMAL PH OF ABOUT 2, FACILITATING ITS ROLE IN DIGESTION DESPITE UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR MOST ENZYMES.

THE STOMACH'S PRODUCTION OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID CREATES A HIGHLY ACIDIC ENVIRONMENT, SUPPORTING PEPSIN ACTIVITY WHILE INHIBITING OTHER ENZYMES.

### KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER

- ENZYMES HAVE SPECIFIC OPTIMAL TEMPERATURES AND PH LEVELS FOR FUNCTION.
- DENATURATION IS AN IRREVERSIBLE STRUCTURAL CHANGE CAUSED BY EXTREME TEMPERATURE OR PH CONDITIONS.
- SOME ENZYMES, LIKE PEPSIN, ARE SPECIALIZED TO OPERATE IN UNUSUAL ENVIRONMENTS SUCH AS HIGH ACIDITY.

UNDERSTANDING THESE FACTORS IS ESSENTIAL FOR STUDYING ENZYME BEHAVIOR IN VARIOUS BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES.

# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES

## LIFE PROCESSES

### ACTIVITY 1: PRACTICAL INVESTIGATION INTO THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON THE ACTIVITY OF AMYLASE

**SAFETY NOTE:**
WEAR EYE PROTECTION AND AVOID SKIN CONTACT WITH THE LIQUIDS. AMYLASE IS HAZARDOUS TO THE EYES.

THE DIGESTIVE ENZYME **AMYLASE** PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN BREAKING DOWN STARCH INTO THE SUGAR **MALTOSE**. TO MEASURE THE ACTIVITY OF AMYLASE, WE CAN RECORD HOW QUICKLY STARCH DISAPPEARS FROM A SOLUTION WHEN EXPOSED TO DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES.

### APPARATUS SETUP
FIGURE 1.8 ILLUSTRATES THE APPARATUS USED TO INVESTIGATE HOW QUICKLY STARCH IS BROKEN DOWN BY AMYLASE AT VARIOUS TEMPERATURES.

THE APPARATUS CONSISTS OF:
- A **STARCH SUSPENSION**, PREPARED BY MIXING STARCH WITH WATER.
- AN **AMYLASE SOLUTION**, SUPPLIED AS A LIQUID.
- AN **IODINE SOLUTION**, USED TO DETECT THE PRESENCE OF STARCH.
- A **SPOTTING TILE** FOR PLACING DROPS OF IODINE SOLUTION.

### PROCEDURE
1. **PREPARATION:**
   - USING A SYRINGE, TRANSFER 5 CM³ OF STARCH SUSPENSION INTO ONE BOILING TUBE.
   - IN ANOTHER BOILING TUBE, ADD 5 CM³ OF AMYLASE SOLUTION USING A SEPARATE SYRINGE.
   - FILL A BEAKER WITH WATER MAINTAINED AT **20°C**.

2. **TEMPERATURE EQUILIBRATION:**
   - PLACE BOTH BOILING TUBES IN THE BEAKER FOR **5 MINUTES** TO ALLOW THEM TO REACH THERMAL EQUILIBRIUM AT 20°C.

3. **MIXING:**
   - POUR THE AMYLASE SOLUTION INTO THE STARCH SUSPENSION WHILE KEEPING THE MIXTURE WITHIN THE WATER BATH.
   - IMMEDIATELY COLLECT A SMALL SAMPLE USING A PIPETTE AND APPLY IT TO THE FIRST DROP OF IODINE SOLUTION ON THE SPOTTING TILE.

4. **OBSERVATION:**
   - NOTE THE COLOR CHANGE OF THE IODINE SOLUTION, WHICH TURNS BLUE-BLACK IN THE PRESENCE OF STARCH.
   - COLLECT SAMPLES EVERY **30 SECONDS FOR 10 MINUTES**, TESTING EACH TIME AS DESCRIBED, UNTIL THE IODINE SOLUTION REMAINS YELLOW, INDICATING COMPLETE STARCH BREAKDOWN.

5. **TEMPERATURE VARIATION:**
   - REPEAT THE EXPERIMENT WHILE MAINTAINING THE WATER BATH AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES RANGING FROM **20°C TO 60°C**.

### RESULTS
THE EXPERIMENT RECORDS THE TIME TAKEN FOR STARCH TO BE COMPLETELY BROKEN DOWN ACROSS VARIOUS TEMPERATURES, PROVIDING INSIGHTS INTO HOW TEMPERATURE AFFECTS AMYLASE ACTIVITY.

# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES: LIFE PROCESSES

IN BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES, THE RATE OF REACTION IS CRUCIAL FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW ORGANISMS FUNCTION. ONE COMMON EXPERIMENT INVOLVES OBSERVING THE BREAKDOWN OF STARCH, WHICH CAN BE MONITORED THROUGH A COLOR CHANGE FROM BLUE-BLACK TO YELLOW.

## UNDERSTANDING REACTION RATES

THE RATE OF REACTION IN BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES CAN BE STUDIED USING EXPERIMENTS LIKE THE ONE MONITORING STARCH BREAKDOWN. THIS PROCESS IS OBSERVED THROUGH COLOR CHANGES OVER TIME, PROVIDING INSIGHTS INTO REACTION DYNAMICS.

### EXPERIMENT OVERVIEW

THE EXPERIMENT EXAMINES HOW TEMPERATURE AFFECTS THE BREAKDOWN OF STARCH. THE TABLE BELOW SHOWS THE COLOR CHANGES AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES OVER TIME:

| TIME (MIN) | 20°C        | 30°C        | 40°C        | 50°C        | 60°C        |
|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 0.0        | BLUE-BLACK  | BLUE-BLACK  | BLUE-BLACK  | BLUE-BLACK  | BLUE-BLACK  |
| 0.5        | BLUE-BLACK  | BLUE-BLACK  | BROWN       | BLUE-BLACK  | BLUE-BLACK  |
| 1.0        | BLUE-BLACK  | BLUE-BLACK  | YELLOW      | BLUE-BLACK  | BLUE-BLACK  |
| 1.5        | BLUE-BLACK  | BLUE-BLACK  | YELLOW      | BLUE-BLACK  | BLUE-BLACK  |
| 2.0        | BLUE-BLACK  | BLUE-BLACK  | YELLOW      | BROWN       | BLUE-BLACK  |
| 2.5        | BLUE-BLACK  | BLUE-BLACK  | YELLOW      | BROWN       | BLUE-BLACK  |
| 3.0        | BLUE-BLACK  | BLUE-BLACK  | YELLOW      | BROWN       | BLUE-BLACK  |
| 3.5        | BLUE-BLACK  | BLUE-BLACK  | YELLOW      | YELLOW      | BLUE-BLACK  |
| 4.0        | BLUE-BLACK  | BLUE-BLACK  | YELLOW      | YELLOW      | BLUE-BLACK  |
| 5.5        | BLUE-BLACK  | BLUE-BLACK  | YELLOW      | YELLOW      | BLUE-BLACK  |
| 6.0        | BLUE-BLACK  | BROWN       | YELLOW      | YELLOW      | BLUE-BLACK  |
| 6.5        | BLUE-BLACK  | BROWN       | YELLOW      | YELLOW      | BLUE-BLACK  |
| 7.0        | BLUE-BLACK  | YELLOW      | YELLOW      | YELLOW      | BLUE-BLACK  |
| 7.5        | BLUE-BLACK  | YELLOW      | YELLOW      | YELLOW      | BROWN       |
| 8.0        | BLUE-BLACK  | YELLOW      | YELLOW      | YELLOW      | BROWN       |
| 8.5        | BROWN       | YELLOW      | YELLOW      | YELLOW      | YELLOW      |
| 9.0        | BROWN       | YELLOW      | YELLOW      | YELLOW      | YELLOW      |
| 9.5        | YELLOW      | YELLOW      | YELLOW      | YELLOW      | YELLOW      |
| 10.0       | YELLOW      | YELLOW      | YELLOW      | YELLOW      | YELLOW      |

THE DATA SHOWS THAT TEMPERATURE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS STARCH BREAKDOWN, WITH HIGHER TEMPERATURES LEADING TO FASTER REACTIONS.

### CALCULATING THE RATE OF REACTION

THE RATE OF REACTION CAN BE CALCULATED BASED ON THE TIME TAKEN FOR STARCH BREAKDOWN. FOR EXAMPLE, AT 50°C, COMPLETE BREAKDOWN OCCURS AFTER 3.5 MINUTES. THE RATE IS COMPUTED USING:

\[ \TEXT{RATE} = \FRAC{\TEXT{VOLUME OF STARCH (5 CM}^3\TEXT{)}}{\TEXT{TIME (3.5 MIN)}} = 1.4 \TEXT{ CM}^3/\TEXT{MIN} \]

### GRAPHING THE RESULTS

TO VISUALIZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TEMPERATURE AND REACTION RATE, PLOT A GRAPH WITH RATE ON THE Y-AXIS AND TEMPERATURE ON THE X-AXIS. THE EXPECTED CURVE WILL SHOW AN INCREASE IN REACTION RATE WITH HIGHER TEMPERATURES, FOLLOWING AN EXPONENTIAL PATTERN.

### EXPERIMENT IMPROVEMENT

IF RESULTS DO NOT MATCH EXPECTATIONS, CONSIDER FACTORS LIKE SOLUTION CONCENTRATION OR ENZYME ACTIVITY. MODIFY THE EXPERIMENT BY ADJUSTING THESE VARIABLES TO ENHANCE ACCURACY AND BETTER UNDERSTAND REACTION DYNAMICS.

BY ADDRESSING THESE CONSIDERATIONS, RESEARCHERS CAN IMPROVE EXPERIMENTAL RELIABILITY AND GAIN DEEPER INSIGHTS INTO BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES.

# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES

## KEY POINT
RESPIRATION IN ORGANISMS IS AN OXIDATION REACTION WHERE OXYGEN BREAKS DOWN FOOD MOLECULES TO RELEASE STORED CHEMICAL ENERGY.

---

## LIFE PROCESSES: HOW CELLS OBTAIN ENERGY

CELLS REQUIRE ENERGY FOR LIFE PROCESSES SUCH AS REPRODUCTION AND GROWTH. THIS ENERGY IS DERIVED FROM THE BREAKDOWN OF FOOD MOLECULES THROUGH A PROCESS KNOWN AS RESPIRATION. RESPIRATION CONVERTS STORED CHEMICAL ENERGY INTO USABLE FORMS, PRIMARILY ATP (ADENOSINE TRIPHOSPHATE), WHICH SERVES AS THE CELL'S ENERGY CURRENCY.

---

## WHAT HAPPENS DURING RESPIRATION

RESPIRATION OCCURS IN ALL CELLS AND INVOLVES THE OXIDATION OF GLUCOSE, A COMMON SUGAR. OXYGEN PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN THIS PROCESS BY REACTING WITH GLUCOSE TO PRODUCE CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER, WHILE RELEASING STORED CHEMICAL ENERGY. THIS ENERGY IS THEN USED TO FORM ATP MOLECULES, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS CELLULAR FUNCTIONS.

---

## ENERGY RELEASE

THE PROCESS OF RESPIRATION RELEASES ENERGY THROUGH THE PRODUCTION OF ATP. WHILE SOME ENERGY IS LOST AS HEAT, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION IS STORED IN ATP, ENABLING PROCESSES LIKE MUSCLE CONTRACTION, ACTIVE TRANSPORT, PROTEIN SYNTHESIS, AND CELL DIVISION. THIS ENERGY RELEASE HELPS MAINTAIN BODY TEMPERATURE IN MAMMALS AND BIRDS.

---

## THE OVERALL REACTION FOR RESPIRATION

THE CHEMICAL EQUATION REPRESENTING RESPIRATION IS:

\[ \TEXT{GLUCOSE} + \TEXT{OXYGEN} \RIGHTARROW \TEXT{CARBON DIOXIDE} + \TEXT{WATER} + \TEXT{ENERGY} \]

IN A MORE DETAILED FORM, THIS REACTION IS:

\[ C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \RIGHTARROW 6CO_2 + 6H_2O + \TEXT{ENERGY} \]

---

## TRACING CARBON PATHWAYS

CARBON FROM GLUCOSE RELEASED AS CARBON DIOXIDE CAN BE TRACED USING A RADIOACTIVE FORM CALLED CARBON-14. THIS METHOD HELPS STUDY THE PATHWAY OF CARBON THROUGH ECOSYSTEMS.

---

## AEROBIC RESPIRATION

RESPIRATION INVOLVING OXYGEN IS TERMED AEROBIC. IT OCCURS IN VARIOUS ORGANISMS AND PROCEEDS IN MULTIPLE STEPS, EACH CATALYZED BY SPECIFIC ENZYMES. THE FINAL STAGES, WHICH RELEASE SIGNIFICANT ENERGY, OCCUR IN MITOCHONDRIA WITHIN CELLS.

---

## ENERGY TRANSFER IN CELLS

ATP ACTS AS THE PRIMARY ENERGY CARRIER IN CELLS. IT TRANSFERS ENERGY FROM RESPIRATION TO OTHER PROCESSES, SUCH AS MUSCLE CONTRACTION AND MOLECULE TRANSPORT, FACILITATING ESSENTIAL CELLULAR ACTIVITIES.

# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES: LIFE PROCESSES

## ATP: THE ENERGY CURRENCY OF THE CELL

ADENOSINE TRIPHOSPHATE (ATP) IS A CRITICAL ORGANIC MOLECULE IN CELLS. COMPOSED OF ADENOSINE ATTACHED TO THREE PHOSPHATE GROUPS, ATP SERVES AS THE PRIMARY ENERGY CURRENCY, FACILITATING ENERGY TRANSFER BETWEEN METABOLIC PROCESSES.

### ATP BREAKDOWN

WHEN ENERGY IS REQUIRED, ATP BREAKS DOWN BY LOSING ONE PHOSPHATE GROUP, FORMING ADENOSINE DIPHOSPHATE (ADP) AND A FREE PHOSPHATE ION. THIS REACTION RELEASES CHEMICAL ENERGY FOR CELLULAR ACTIVITIES.

### ATP FORMATION

DURING RESPIRATION, THE REVERSE OCCURS. ENERGY FROM GLUCOSE OXIDATION IS USED TO ADD A PHOSPHATE GROUP BACK TO ADP, REGENERATING ATP. THIS CYCLE MAINTAINS THE CELL'S ENERGY BALANCE.

## ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION

IN OXYGEN-DEPRIVED ENVIRONMENTS, CELLS RESORT TO ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION, A LESS EFFICIENT PROCESS WHERE GLUCOSE IS ONLY PARTIALLY BROKEN DOWN.

### ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION IN YEAST

YEAST CELLS, SINGLE-CELLED FUNGI, EMPLOY ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION WHEN OXYGEN LEVELS ARE LOW. GLUCOSE IS CONVERTED INTO ETHANOL AND CARBON DIOXIDE, RELEASING ENERGY:

GLUCOSE IS PARTIALLY BROKEN DOWN INTO ETHANOL AND CARBON DIOXIDE, PRODUCING SOME ENERGY.

THIS PROCESS IS CRUCIAL IN BAKING, WHERE YEAST FERMENTATION RELEASES CARBON DIOXIDE, AIDING DOUGH EXPANSION.

### ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION IN MUSCLE CELLS

MUSCLE CELLS ALSO USE ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION DURING INTENSE ACTIVITY. GLUCOSE IS CONVERTED INTO LACTATE:

GLUCOSE IS TRANSFORMED INTO LACTATE, GENERATING ENERGY FOR SHORT BURSTS OF ACTIVITY.

THIS PROCESS ALLOWS MUSCLES TO FUNCTION BRIEFLY, SUCH AS DURING SPRINTING OR HEAVY LIFTING, THOUGH LACTATE ACCUMULATION CAN LEAD TO FATIGUE.

BY PROVIDING A TEMPORARY ENERGY SOURCE, ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION ENABLES ORGANISMS LIKE YEAST AND MUSCLE CELLS TO FUNCTION UNDER STRESS. WHILE LESS EFFICIENT THAN AEROBIC RESPIRATION, IT IS VITAL FOR VARIOUS BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES.

# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES

## LIFE PROCESSES

IT WAS ONCE BELIEVED THAT LACTATE IS TOXIC AND CAUSES MUSCLE FATIGUE. HOWEVER, RECENT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT LACTATE ACTUALLY DELAYS MUSCLE FATIGUE. FATIGUE DURING EXERCISE IS PRIMARILY CAUSED BY OTHER PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE MUSCLES.

LACTATE, ALSO KNOWN AS LACTIC ACID, IS PRODUCED DURING ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION WHEN OXYGEN SUPPLY IS INSUFFICIENT. AFTER EXERCISE, THIS LACTATE IS OXIDIZED AEROBICALLY IN THE MITOCHONDRIA. THE AMOUNT OF OXYGEN REQUIRED TO FULLY OXIDIZE THE ACCUMULATED LACTATE IS REFERRED TO AS THE **OXYGEN DEBT**.

---

## ACTIVITY 2: PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION OF CARBON DIOXIDE PRODUCTION BY SMALL LIVING ORGANISMS

**SAFETY NOTE:** WEAR PROTECTIVE EYEWEAR AND HANDLE ORGANISMS CAREFULLY TO AVOID SKIN CONTACT.

HYDROGEN CARBONATE INDICATOR SOLUTION CHANGES FROM ORANGE TO YELLOW WHEN EXPOSED TO CARBON DIOXIDE. THIS SENSITIVITY MAKES IT USEFUL FOR DETECTING CO2 PRODUCTION IN SMALL ORGANISMS, SUCH AS WOODLICE, MAGGOTS, OR GERMINATING SEEDS.

### PROCEDURE:
1. PLACE THE SELECTED ORGANISMS IN A STOPPERED BOILING TUBE CONTAINING THE HYDROGEN CARBONATE SOLUTION. A GAUZE PLATFORM SUPPORTS THE ORGANISMS TO PREVENT CONTACT WITH THE CHEMICAL (SEE FIGURE 1.10).

2. OBSERVE WHICH ORGANISM CHANGES THE INDICATOR'S COLOR MOST QUICKLY. THIS OBSERVATION MAY LEAD TO A HYPOTHESIS ABOUT CO2 PRODUCTION RATES AMONG DIFFERENT SPECIES.

3. PLAN AN INVESTIGATION TO TEST YOUR HYPOTHESIS, INCLUDING VARIABLES TO CONTROL AND A FOURTH EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AS A CONTROL GROUP (REFER TO APPENDIX A FOR DETAILS). CONDUCT THE EXPERIMENT USING SIMILAR APPARATUS AND ORGANISMS IF POSSIBLE.

THIS REFORMATTING COMBINES RELATED INFORMATION INTO CLEAR PARAGRAPHS, REMOVES BULLET POINTS, AND MAINTAINS A HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE WITHOUT UNNECESSARY ELEMENTS.

### ACTIVITY 3: PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION THAT HEAT IS PRODUCED BY RESPIRATION

**SAFETY NOTE:** WEAR EYE PROTECTION WHEN USING BLEACH AND AVOID SKIN CONTACT.

#### MATERIALS NEEDED:
- TWO BATCHES OF PEAS (ONE SOAKED, ONE BOILED)
- 10% BLEACH SOLUTION
- DISTILLED WATER FOR RINSING
- INVERTED VACUUM FLASKS
- COTTON WOOL
- THERMOMETER

#### PROCEDURE:
1. SOAK ONE BATCH OF PEAS IN WATER FOR 24 HOURS TO ENCOURAGE GERMINATION.
2. BOIL A SECOND BATCH OF PEAS TO KILL THEM.
3. DISINFECT EACH BATCH BY WASHING WITH A 10% BLEACH SOLUTION.
4. RINSE THE PEAS TWICE WITH DISTILLED WATER TO REMOVE RESIDUAL BLEACH.
5. PLACE EACH BATCH INTO AN INVERTED VACUUM FLASK, LEAVING SOME AIR INSIDE. THIS SETUP ALLOWS FOR TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT WHILE INSULATING THE CONTENTS.

!FIGURE 1.11: EXPERIMENT TO SHOW THAT HEAT IS PRODUCED DURING RESPIRATION IN GERMINATING PEAS

#### EXPERIMENT SETUP:
- **GERMINATING PEAS:** PLACED IN ONE FLASK.
- **DEAD PEAS:** PLACED IN ANOTHER FLASK.
- **COTTON WOOL:** USED TO ALLOW CARBON DIOXIDE GAS, DENSER THAN AIR, TO ESCAPE. THIS PREVENTS HARM TO THE PEAS.

#### OBSERVATIONS:
- THE APPARATUS WAS LEFT SET UP FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.
- TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN AT THE START AND END OF THE EXPERIMENT.

**RESULTS:**
- INITIAL TEMPERATURE IN BOTH FLASKS: 21 °C
- FINAL TEMPERATURE IN THE FLASK WITH DEAD PEAS: 21 °C
- FINAL TEMPERATURE IN THE FLASK WITH LIVING PEAS: 24 °C

### DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
1. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT LIVING PEAS PRODUCE HEAT THROUGH RESPIRATION, AS EVIDENCED BY THE TEMPERATURE INCREASE.
2. DISINFECTING THE PEAS REMOVES SURFACE MICROORGANISMS, ENSURING THE EXPERIMENT'S VALIDITY.
3. THE DEAD PEAS SERVE AS A CONTROL TO CONFIRM THAT THE OBSERVED TEMPERATURE CHANGE IS DUE TO BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES.

THIS EXPERIMENT DEMONSTRATES THAT LIVING ORGANISMS GENERATE HEAT DURING RESPIRATION, WITH GERMINATING PEAS SHOWING A TEMPERATURE RISE COMPARED TO DEAD PEERS.

# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES

## DIFFUSION

### KEY POINT
DIFFUSION IS THE NET MOVEMENT OF PARTICLES (MOLECULES OR IONS) FROM A REGION OF HIGH CONCENTRATION TO A REGION OF LOW CONCENTRATION, I.E., DOWN A CONCENTRATION GRADIENT.

---

### MOVEMENT OF MATERIALS IN AND OUT OF CELLS

CELLS REQUIRE CERTAIN SUBSTANCES LIKE GLUCOSE AND OXYGEN FROM THEIR SURROUNDINGS WHILE EXPELLING OTHERS SUCH AS CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER. THE CELL SURFACE MEMBRANE PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN THIS PROCESS BY ACTING AS A SELECTIVELY PERMEABLE BARRIER, CONTROLLING THE MOVEMENT OF CHEMICALS.

THERE ARE THREE PRIMARY MECHANISMS FOR MOLECULAR TRANSPORT ACROSS THE MEMBRANE: DIFFUSION, ACTIVE TRANSPORT, AND OSMOSIS.

#### DIFFUSION
MANY SUBSTANCES CAN PASS THROUGH THE MEMBRANE VIA DIFFUSION. THIS PROCESS OCCURS WHEN THERE IS A CONCENTRATION GRADIENT—WHERE A SUBSTANCE IS PRESENT IN HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS IN ONE AREA THAN ANOTHER. FOR INSTANCE, DURING RESPIRATION, CELLS PRODUCE CARBON DIOXIDE, LEADING TO ITS ACCUMULATION INSIDE THE CELL COMPARED TO OUTSIDE. THIS CREATES A CONCENTRATION GRADIENT FAVORING THE NET MOVEMENT OF CARBON DIOXIDE MOLECULES FROM INSIDE TO OUTSIDE.

THE MOVEMENT OF CARBON DIOXIDE IS DRIVEN BY THE KINETIC ENERGY OF MOLECULES, ALLOWING THEM TO TRAVERSE THE MEMBRANE IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE HIGHER INTERNAL CONCENTRATION, THERE IS A NET OUTWARD FLOW, AS EXPLAINED IN FIGURE 1.12.

CONVERSELY, OXYGEN MOVES INTO THE CELL THROUGH DIFFUSION SINCE IT IS CONSUMED DURING RESPIRATION, CREATING A GRADIENT THAT DRAWS IT FROM THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT INTO THE CELLULAR INTERIOR.

---

### FACTORS AFFECTING THE RATE OF DIFFUSION

THE RATE AT WHICH DIFFUSION OCCURS IS INFLUENCED BY SEVERAL FACTORS:

- **CONCENTRATION GRADIENT**: THE STEEPNESS OF CONCENTRATION DIFFERENCES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTS DIFFUSION SPEED.
- **SURFACE AREA TO VOLUME RATIO**: A HIGHER RATIO ENHANCES DIFFUSION RATES DUE TO INCREASED MEMBRANE EXPOSURE RELATIVE TO CELL VOLUME.
- **DISTANCE**: LONGER DISTANCES REDUCE DIFFUSION EFFICIENCY AS MOLECULES MUST TRAVEL FURTHER AGAINST RESISTANCE.
- **TEMPERATURE**: HIGHER TEMPERATURES INCREASE KINETIC ENERGY, THEREBY ACCELERATING DIFFUSION.

UNDERSTANDING THESE PRINCIPLES IS ESSENTIAL FOR GRASPING HOW CELLS INTERACT WITH THEIR ENVIRONMENT AND MAINTAIN INTERNAL BALANCE, KNOWN AS HOMEOSTASIS.

### ACTIVITY 4: PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION OF DIFFUSION IN A JELLY

THIS ACTIVITY DEMONSTRATES DIFFUSION USING AGAR JELLY, ILLUSTRATING HOW SUBSTANCES DIFFUSE THROUGH A CELL-LIKE MEDIUM. THE REACTION BETWEEN HYDROCHLORIC ACID AND POTASSIUM PERMANGANATE SOLUTION WILL SHOW COLOR CHANGES, INDICATING CHEMICAL INTERACTION.

AGAR, WITH ITS HIGH WATER CONTENT, MIMICS THE CYTOPLASM OF CELLS, PROVIDING A STRUCTURED MEDIUM FOR THIS DEMONSTRATION.

---

### MATERIALS NEEDED
- PETRI DISH: USED TO CREATE A LAYER OF AGAR JELLY.
- AGAR JELLY DYED PURPLE WITH POTASSIUM PERMANGANATE: TO SIMULATE CELL CYTOPLASM.
- HYDROCHLORIC ACID: REACTS WITH POTASSIUM PERMANGANATE, CAUSING COLOR LOSS.
- CUBES OF AGAR JELLY: CUT INTO DIFFERENT SIZES (2 CM, 1 CM, AND 0.5 CM) TO COMPARE DIFFUSION RATES.

---

### PROCEDURE

1. PREPARE A PETRI DISH CONTAINING A 2 CM DEEP LAYER OF AGAR JELLY DYED PURPLE WITH POTASSIUM PERMANGANATE.
2. CUT THREE CUBES FROM THE AGAR:
   - A 2 CM CUBE
   - A 1 CM CUBE
   - A 0.5 CM CUBE

EACH CUBE'S DIMENSIONS AFFECT ITS VOLUME AND SURFACE AREA, INFLUENCING THE DIFFUSION RATE.

THE TABLE BELOW COMPARES THESE MEASUREMENTS:

| LENGTH OF SIDE OF CUBE (CM) | VOLUME OF CUBE (CM³) | SURFACE AREA OF CUBE (CM²) | RATIO OF SURFACE AREA TO VOLUME |
|------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 2                            | \(2 \TIMES 2 \TIMES 2 = 8\) | \(2 \TIMES 2 \TIMES 6 = 24\)   | \(24 / 8 = 3\)                   |
| 1                            | \(1 \TIMES 1 \TIMES 1 = 1\) | \(1 \TIMES 1 \TIMES 6 = 6\)    | \(6 / 1 = 6\)                    |
| 0.5                          | \(0.5 \TIMES 0.5 \TIMES 0.5 = 0.125\) | \(0.5 \TIMES 0.5 \TIMES 6 = 1.5\) | \(1.5 / 0.125 = 12\)              |

THE SMALLEST CUBE (0.5 CM) HAS THE HIGHEST SURFACE AREA TO VOLUME RATIO, A PRINCIPLE OBSERVED IN CELLS.

3. CAREFULLY DROP EACH CUBE INTO A BEAKER CONTAINING DILUTE HYDROCHLORIC ACID. OBSERVE THE COLOR CHANGE FROM PURPLE TO COLORLESS, INDICATING THE REACTION BETWEEN POTASSIUM PERMANGANATE AND HYDROCHLORIC ACID.

---

### OBSERVATION
THE SMALLEST CUBE TURNS COLORLESS FIRST DUE TO ITS HIGHER SURFACE AREA TO VOLUME RATIO, FACILITATING FASTER DIFFUSION OF SUBSTANCES.

---

### QUESTIONS
1. WHICH CUBE WOULD BE THE FIRST TO LOSE ITS PURPLE COLOR?
2. IF THESE CUBES REPRESENTED CELLS OF DIFFERENT SIZES, WHICH CELL WOULD HAVE THE MOST DIFFICULTY ABSORBING SUBSTANCES VIA DIFFUSION?

THIS EXPERIMENT CAN BE REPLICATED USING SIMILAR APPARATUS TO EXPLORE DIFFUSION PROCESSES IN MORE DETAIL.

# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES

## LIFE PROCESSES

### ACTIVE TRANSPORT
ACTIVE TRANSPORT IS THE MOVEMENT OF SUBSTANCES AGAINST A CONCENTRATION GRADIENT, POWERED BY ENERGY FROM CELLULAR RESPIRATION. THIS PROCESS IS CRUCIAL WHEN A CELL REQUIRES ABSORBING A SUBSTANCE PRESENT AT LOW CONCENTRATIONS OUTSIDE.

**KEY POINT:**
ACTIVE TRANSPORT FUNCTIONS LIKE A PUMP, MOVING IONS OR MOLECULES IN OR OUT OF CELLS. THE PUMPS ARE LARGE PROTEIN MOLECULES LOCATED IN THE CELL MEMBRANE, DRIVEN BY ATP BREAKDOWN.

**EXAMPLE:**
IN THE HUMAN SMALL INTESTINE, GLUCOSE IS ABSORBED INTO INTESTINAL CELLS VIA ACTIVE TRANSPORT. SIMILARLY, PLANT ROOTS ABSORB CERTAIN MINERAL IONS USING THIS METHOD. CELLS EMPLOY ACTIVE TRANSPORT TO REGULATE THE INTAKE OF VARIOUS SUBSTANCES.

### OSMOSIS
OSMOSIS IS A TYPE OF DIFFUSION WHERE WATER MOVES ACROSS CELL MEMBRANES FROM A MORE DILUTE SOLUTION TO A MORE CONCENTRATED ONE. THIS PROCESS IS ESSENTIAL FOR WATER MOVEMENT BETWEEN CELLS, PARTICULARLY IN PLANT ROOTS.

**KEY POINT:**
OSMOSIS INVOLVES THE NET MOVEMENT OF WATER FROM A DILUTE SOLUTION TO A MORE CONCENTRATED SOLUTION ACROSS A PARTIALLY PERMEABLE MEMBRANE. THIS PROCESS FACILITATES WATER TRANSFER IN PLANT ROOT CELLS.

### SPECIALISED EXCHANGE SURFACES
ORGANISMS ADAPT SPECIFIC STRUCTURES FOR EFFICIENT SUBSTANCE EXCHANGE WITH THEIR SURROUNDINGS, OFTEN THROUGH LARGE SURFACE AREAS RELATIVE TO VOLUME.

**KEY POINT:**
THE TERM 'ADAPTATION' REFERS TO STRUCTURAL FEATURES SUITED TO AN ORGANISM'S FUNCTION, A FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT IN BIOLOGY.

**EXAMPLES IN ANIMALS:**
- **ALVEOLI:** LUNGS HAVE ALVEOLI FOR OXYGEN AND CARBON DIOXIDE EXCHANGE DURING BREATHING.
- **VILLI:** INTESTINAL VILLI PROVIDE A LARGE SURFACE AREA FOR NUTRIENT ABSORPTION.

**EXAMPLES IN PLANTS:**
- **SPONGY MESOPHYLL:** LEAVES USE THIS TISSUE FOR GAS EXCHANGE.
- **ROOT HAIRS:** THESE STRUCTURES ENHANCE WATER AND NUTRIENT ABSORPTION.

## CELLS, TISSUES, AND ORGANS
CELLS WITH SIMILAR FUNCTIONS GROUP INTO TISSUES. FOR EXAMPLE, MUSCLE CELLS FORM MUSCLE TISSUE, WHICH IS PART OF LARGER ORGAN SYSTEMS LIKE THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM, COMPRISING THE GUT AND ASSOCIATED GLANDS.

**EXAMPLE:**
HUMAN ORGANS INCLUDE THE HEART, LUNGS, AND LIVER. PLANTS HAVE LEAVES, ROOTS, STEMS, AND FLOWERS. IN ANIMALS, ORGAN SYSTEMS COLLABORATE TO PERFORM SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS, SUCH AS DIGESTION.

# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES

## LIFE PROCESSES OVERVIEW

THE HUMAN BODY IS COMPOSED OF VARIOUS SYSTEMS WORKING TOGETHER TO SUSTAIN LIFE. THESE SYSTEMS INCLUDE THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM, WHICH BREAKS DOWN FOOD AND ABSORBS NUTRIENTS; THE GAS EXCHANGE SYSTEM, INVOLVING THE LUNGS FOR OXYGEN AND CARBON DIOXIDE EXCHANGE; THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM, WHICH TRANSPORTS MATERIALS THROUGHOUT THE BODY VIA THE HEART AND BLOOD VESSELS; THE EXCRETORY SYSTEM, RESPONSIBLE FOR FILTERING WASTE FROM THE BLOOD THROUGH THE KIDNEYS; THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, COORDINATING BODY ACTIONS THROUGH THE BRAIN, SPINAL CORD, AND NERVES; THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM, USING GLANDS TO SECRETE HORMONES AS CHEMICAL MESSENGERS; AND THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM, MANAGING SPERM PRODUCTION IN MALES AND EGG DEVELOPMENT IN FEMALES.

## MAIN ORGANS OF THE HUMAN BODY

THE HUMAN BODY'S ORGANS PLAY CRUCIAL ROLES IN DIFFERENT SYSTEMS. THE BRAIN REGULATES BODILY FUNCTIONS AND CONTROLS THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. THE LUNGS FACILITATE GAS EXCHANGE, BRINGING IN OXYGEN AND RELEASING CARBON DIOXIDE. THE HEART PUMPS BLOOD TO CIRCULATE NUTRIENTS AND WASTE PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT THE BODY. THE KIDNEYS FILTER TOXIC SUBSTANCES FROM THE BLOODSTREAM. THE LIVER PRODUCES BILE FOR DIGESTION AND PLAYS A ROLE IN DETOXIFICATION. THE PANCREAS AIDS IN DIGESTION BY RELEASING ENZYMES. THE STOMACH PROCESSES FOOD THROUGH ACID SECRETION. THE INTESTINES ABSORB NUTRIENTS AFTER DIGESTION. THE BLADDER STORES AND EXPELS URINE. IN FEMALES, THE OVARIES PRODUCE EGGS, WHILE IN MALES, THE TESTES GENERATE SPERM.

UNDERSTANDING THESE SYSTEMS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED ORGANS IS ESSENTIAL FOR GRASPING HOW THE HUMAN BODY MAINTAINS HOMEOSTASIS AND FUNCTIONS EFFECTIVELY.

# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES: LIFE PROCESSES

ELECTRON MICROGRAPHS ALLOW US TO EXAMINE CELLS AT A MUCH GREATER MAGNIFICATION THAN LIGHT MICROSCOPES. THEY REVEAL STRUCTURAL DETAILS THAT ARE OTHERWISE INVISIBLE, SUCH AS THE PRESENCE OF RIBOSOMES.

THE RESOLUTION OF A LIGHT MICROSCOPE IS APPROXIMATELY 200 NANOMETERS, WHILE ELECTRON MICROSCOPES CAN DISTINGUISH STRUCTURES SMALLER THAN 1 NM. THIS EXPLAINS WHY RIBOSOMES, WHICH MEASURE ABOUT 25 NM IN DIAMETER, ARE VISIBLE ONLY UNDER AN ELECTRON MICROSCOPE.

CELLS CONTAIN VARIOUS ORGANELLES ENCLOSED BY MEMBRANES, INCLUDING THE NUCLEUS, MITOCHONDRIA, AND CHLOROPLASTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE CYTOPLASM IS FILLED WITH AN EXTENSIVE SYSTEM OF MEMBRANES KNOWN AS THE ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM (ER). SOME PORTIONS OF THE ER ARE COVERED WITH RIBOSOMES, WHERE PROTEIN SYNTHESIS OCCURS.

THE CELL MEMBRANE PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN SEPARATING CELLULAR FUNCTIONS INTO DISTINCT COMPARTMENTS. FOR INSTANCE, THE ENZYMES AND REACTIONS INVOLVED IN AEROBIC RESPIRATION ARE CONFINED WITHIN MITOCHONDRIA, PREVENTING THEM FROM INTERACTING WITH OTHER CYTOPLASMIC PROCESSES.

# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES

# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES

## LIFE PROCESSES

### ENZYMES AND TEMPERATURE

ENZYMES IN THE HUMAN BODY FUNCTION OPTIMALLY AT A TEMPERATURE OF APPROXIMATELY 37°C. THIS TEMPERATURE IS CRUCIAL FOR MAINTAINING ENZYME ACTIVITY, AS ENZYMES ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE.

THE ACTIVITY OF AN ENZYME CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY WITH TEMPERATURE. AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES, SUCH AS 60°C, THE ENZYME'S STRUCTURE MAY BECOME MORE FLEXIBLE, INCREASING ITS CATALYTIC EFFICIENCY. HOWEVER, AT EVEN HIGHER TEMPERATURES, SUCH AS 90°C, THE ENZYME MAY DENATURE, LOSING ITS SHAPE AND FUNCTION.

### SKILLS: INTERPRETATION

DIFFUSION IS THE PASSIVE MOVEMENT OF MOLECULES FROM AN AREA OF HIGHER CONCENTRATION TO ONE OF LOWER CONCENTRATION. ACTIVE TRANSPORT, ON THE OTHER HAND, REQUIRES ENERGY AND MOVES MOLECULES AGAINST THEIR CONCENTRATION GRADIENT.

IN THE HUMAN KIDNEY, TUBULE CELLS PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN GLUCOSE ABSORPTION. THESE CELLS CONTAIN NUMEROUS MITOCHONDRIA, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL FOR ENERGY PRODUCTION, ENABLING THE CELL TO TRANSPORT GLUCOSE INTO THE BLOODSTREAM.

### CELL FUNCTION IN THE HUMAN KIDNEY

THE DIAGRAM ILLUSTRATES A KIDNEY TUBULE CELL WITH SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS. THE CELL'S SURFACE MEMBRANE IS ADAPTED THROUGH FOLDING, FACILITATING EFFICIENT GLUCOSE ABSORPTION FROM THE TUBULE FLUID INTO THE BLOOD.

#### COMPONENTS OF THE CELL

THE NUCLEUS CONTAINS THE GENETIC MATERIAL CRUCIAL FOR THE CELL'S FUNCTION. MITOCHONDRIA, LOCATED IN LARGE NUMBERS WITHIN THE CELL, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENERGY PRODUCTION, WHICH IS VITAL FOR GLUCOSE TRANSPORT ACROSS THE CELL MEMBRANE.

### SKILLS: ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION

1. THE PRESENCE OF NUMEROUS MITOCHONDRIA IN THE TUBULE CELL SUGGESTS THAT THEY ARE UTILIZED FOR ENERGY PRODUCTION TO FACILITATE GLUCOSE TRANSPORT INTO THE BLOODSTREAM AT POINT 'A'.

2. AT POINT 'B', THE MOVEMENT OF IONS ACROSS THE MEMBRANE LIKELY INVOLVES PASSIVE DIFFUSION, AS NO MENTION OF ACTIVE TRANSPORT IS REQUIRED HERE.

3. THE FOLDED SURFACE MEMBRANE AT 'B' ENHANCES THE CELL'S ABILITY TO ABSORB GLUCOSE EFFICIENTLY BY INCREASING THE SURFACE AREA AVAILABLE FOR TRANSPORT PROCESSES.

UNDERSTANDING THESE LIFE PROCESSES AND CELLULAR ADAPTATIONS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO GRASPING HOW ORGANISMS FUNCTION.

# THE VARIETY OF LIVING ORGANISMS

## INTRODUCTION
THERE IS AN ENORMOUS VARIETY OF LIVING ORGANISMS ON EARTH. BIOLOGISTS CLASSIFY THESE ORGANISMS INTO GROUPS BASED ON THEIR STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION. MEMBERS OF EACH GROUP SHARE CERTAIN FEATURES IN COMMON, REFLECTING THEIR DESCENT FROM A COMMON ANCESTOR THROUGH THE PROCESS OF EVOLUTION.

## CLASSIFICATION OF ORGANISMS
ORGANISMS ARE CLASSIFIED INTO FIVE MAJOR GROUPS: PLANTS, ANIMALS, FUNGI, PROTOCTISTS, AND BACTERIA. THIS CLASSIFICATION HELPS BIOLOGISTS UNDERSTAND THE DIVERSITY OF LIFE ON EARTH.

### PLANTS
FLOWERING PLANTS, SUCH AS THOSE SHOWN IN FIGURE 2.1, ARE A KEY GROUP WITHIN THE PLANT KINGDOM. THIS GROUP ALSO INCLUDES SIMPLER PLANTS LIKE MOSSES AND FERNS.

- **CHARACTERISTICS OF PLANTS:**
- MULTICELLULAR STRUCTURE, WITH CELLS CONTAINING CHLOROPLASTS FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS.
- PHOTOSYNTHESIS CONVERTS WATER AND CARBON DIOXIDE INTO ORGANIC COMPOUNDS LIKE STARCH AND SUCROSE.

#### FIGURE 2.1
- (A) A PEA PLANT: LEAVES AND STEM CELLS CONTAIN CHLOROPLASTS, GIVING THEM THEIR GREEN COLOR. WHITE FLOWERS ARE POLLINATED BY INSECTS.
- (B) MAIZE PLANTS ARE POLLINATED BY WIND; MALE FLOWERS PRODUCE POLLEN.
- (C) FEMALE MAIZE FLOWERS PRODUCE SEEDS AFTER POLLINATION.

THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF FLOWERING PLANTS WILL BE EXPLORED IN UNIT 3.

## CONCLUSION
UNDERSTANDING ORGANISM CLASSIFICATION APPRECIATES LIFE'S COMPLEXITY. EACH GROUP PLAYS A ROLE IN ECOSYSTEMS, AIDING EFFECTIVE STUDY THROUGH RECOGNITION OF THEIR FEATURES.
