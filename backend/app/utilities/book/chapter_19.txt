# NATURAL SELECTION, EVOLUTION AND SELECTIVE BREEDING

Over millions of years, life on this planet has evolved from its simple beginnings into the vast range of organisms present today. This has happened by a process called natural selection. This chapter looks at natural selection, as well as traditional methods of selective breeding and modern developments involving cloned organisms.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

- Explain Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection
- Understand how resistance to antibiotics can increase in bacterial populations
- Understand how selective breeding can be used to produce plants with desired characteristics
- Understand how selective breeding can be used to produce animals with desirable characteristics

The meaning of 'evolution' is that species of animals and plants are not fixed in their form, but change over time. It is not a new idea. For thousands of years philosophers have discussed this theory. By the beginning of the nineteenth century there was overwhelming evidence for evolution, and many scientists had accepted that it had taken place. What was missing was an understanding of the mechanism by which evolution could have occurred.

The person who proposed the mechanism for evolution that is widely accepted today was the English biologist Charles Darwin (Figure 19.1). He called the mechanism natural selection.

## THE WORK OF CHARLES DARWIN

Charles Darwin was the son of a country doctor. He did not do particularly well at school or university and was unable to decide on a profession. His father is supposed to have said: 'you're good for nothing but shooting guns and rat-catching ... you'll be a disgrace to yourself and all of your family'. He was wrong – Darwin went on to become one of the most famous scientists of all time!

At the age of 22, Charles Darwin became the unpaid biologist aboard the survey ship HMS Beagle, which left England for a five-year voyage in 1831 (Figure 19.2).

Figure 19.2 The five-year journey of HMS Beagle:

| Region         | Details                                    |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| North America  | Pacific Ocean coast                        |
| South America  | Atlantic coast, including Galapagos Islands|
| Africa         | Southern tip                               |
| Australia      | Coastal areas                              |
| Asia           | Southern coast                             |
| Europe         | Return to England                          |

The map shows the route of the HMS Beagle starting from England, traveling south along the Atlantic coast of South America, around Cape Horn, up the Pacific coast, across to the Galapagos Islands, then westward across the Pacific and Indian Oceans, around the southern tip of Africa, and back to England.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION

## NATURAL SELECTION, EVOLUTION AND SELECTIVE BREEDING

### DID YOU KNOW?

A fossil is the remains of an animal or plant that lived thousands or millions of years ago, preserved in sedimentary rocks. Fossils are formed when minerals replace the materials in bone and tissue, creating a replica of the original organism in the rock.

During the voyage, Darwin collected hundreds of specimens and made many observations about the variety of organisms and the ways in which they were adapted to their environments. He gained much information, in particular, from the variety of life forms in South America and the Galapagos Islands. Darwin was influenced by the work of Charles Lyell who was, at the time, laying the foundations of modern geology. Lyell was using the evidence of rock layers to suggest that the surface of the Earth was constantly changing. The layers of sediments in rocks represented different time periods. Darwin noticed that the fossils found in successive layers of rocks often changed slightly through the layers. He suggested that life forms were continually changing – evolving.

On his return to England, Darwin began to evaluate his data and wrote several essays, introducing the ideas of natural selection. He arrived at his theory of natural selection from observations made during his voyage on HMS Beagle and from deductions made from those observations. Darwin's observations were that:

- organisms generally produce more offspring than are needed to replace them – a single female salmon can release 5 million eggs per year; a giant puffball fungus produces 40 million spores
- despite this over-reproduction, stable, established populations of organisms generally remain the same size – the seas are not overflowing with salmon, and we are not surrounded by lots of giant puffball fungi!
- members of the same species are not identical – they show variation.

He made two important deductions from these observations.

- From the first two observations he deduced that there is a 'struggle for existence'. Many offspring are produced, yet the population stays the same size. There must be competition for resources and many individuals must die.
- From the third observation he deduced that, if some offspring survive while others die, those organisms best suited to their environment would survive to reproduce. Those less suited will die. This gave rise to the phrase 'survival of the fittest'.

### KEY POINT

The phrase 'survival of the fittest' does not mean physical fitness, but biological fitness. This depends on how well adapted an organism is to its environment so that it is successful in reproducing. A good way of putting it is; 'survival of the individuals that will leave most offspring in later generations'.

Notice a key phrase in the second deduction – the best-suited organisms survive to reproduce. This means that those characteristics that give the organism a better chance of surviving will be passed on to the next generation. Fewer of the individuals that are less suited to the environment survive to reproduce. The next generation will have more of the type that is better adapted and fewer of the less well adapted type. This will be repeated in each generation.

Another naturalist, Alfred Russell Wallace, had also studied life forms in South America and Indonesia and had reached the same conclusions as Darwin. Darwin and Wallace published a scientific paper on natural selection jointly, although it was Darwin who went on to develop the ideas further. In 1859, he published his now famous book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (usually shortened to The Origin of Species).

This book changed forever the way in which biologists think about how species originate. Darwin went on to suggest that humans could have evolved from ape-like ancestors. For this he was ridiculed, largely by people who had misunderstood his ideas (Figure 19.3). He also carried out considerable research in other areas of biology, such as plant tropisms (see Chapter 12).

Figure 19.3 Darwin's ideas were unpopular and many newspapers of the time made fun of them.

## VARIATION AND SELECTION

### NATURAL SELECTION, EVOLUTION AND SELECTIVE BREEDING

#### KEY POINT

When Darwin proposed his theory of natural selection, he did not know about genes and how they control characteristics. Gregor Mendel had yet to publish his work on inheritance, and as you have seen, the significance of Mendel's work was not recognised until 1903.

The theory of natural selection proposes that some factor in the environment 'selects' which forms of a species will survive to reproduce. Forms that are not well adapted will not survive.

The following is a summary of how we think natural selection works:

1. there is variation within the species
2. changing conditions in the environment (called a selection pressure) favours one particular form of the species (which has a selective advantage)
3. the frequency of the favoured form increases (it is selected for) under these conditions (survival of the fittest)
4. the frequency of the less well adapted form decreases under these conditions (it is selected against).

As you have seen, many gene mutations are harmful, and cells that carry them will not usually survive. Some mutations are 'neutral' and if they arise in the gametes, may be passed on without affecting the survival of the offspring. However, a few mutations can actually be beneficial to an organism. Beneficial mutations are the 'raw material' that are ultimately the source of new inherited variation.

### SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW NATURAL SELECTION MIGHT HAVE WORKED

#### THE HOVERFLY

Figure 19.4 shows two species of insect: a wasp and a hoverfly. Wasps can defend themselves against predators using a sting. They also have a body with yellow and black stripes. This is called a 'warning colouration'. Predators such as birds soon learn that these colours mean that wasps have the sting, and they avoid attacking them.

Hoverflies do not have a sting. However, they have an appearance that is very like a wasp, with similar yellow and black stripes – they are 'mimics' of wasps. Predators treat hoverflies as if they do have a sting.

Clearly, mimicking a wasp is an advantage to the hoverfly. How could they have evolved this appearance? We can explain how it could have happened by natural selection.

The selection pressure was predation by birds and other animals. Among the ancestors of present-day hoverflies there would have been variation in colours. As a result of mutations, some hoverflies gained genes that produced stripes on their bodies. These insects were less likely to be eaten by predators than hoverflies without the stripes – they had a selective advantage.

Since the hoverflies with stripes were more likely to survive being eaten, they were more likely to reproduce, and would pass on the genes for stripes to their offspring. This process continued over many generations. Gradually more mutations and selection for 'better' stripes took place, until the hoverflies evolved the excellent warning colouration that they have today.

#### KEY POINT

Note that perfect stripes didn't have to appear straight away. Even a slight stripy appearance could give a small selective advantage over hoverflies without stripes. This would be enough to result in an increase in stripy hoverflies in the next generation.

### THE POLAR BEAR

The polar bear lives in the Arctic, inhabiting landmasses and sea ice covering the waters within the Arctic Circle (Figure 19.5). It is a large predatory carnivore, mainly hunting seals. One way the bear hunts is to wait near holes in the ice where seals come up to breathe. It also silently approaches and attacks seals that are resting on the ice.

Polar bears have many adaptations that suit them to their habitat. These include:

- a thick layer of white fur, which reduces heat loss and acts as camouflage in the snow
- wide, large paws. These help with walking in the snow, and are used for swimming
- strong, muscular legs – a bear can swim continuously in the cold Arctic waters for days
- nostrils that close when the bear is swimming under water
- a large body mass. Polar bears are the largest bears on Earth. An adult male averages 350 to 550 kilograms, and the record is over 1000 kilograms. This large size results in the animal having a small surface area to volume ratio, which reduces heat loss
- a 10 centimetre thick layer of insulating fat under the skin
- a well developed sense of smell – used to detect the bear's prey
- bumps on the pads of the paws to provide grip on the ice
- short, powerful claws, which also provide grip, and are needed for holding the heavy prey.

The polar bear is thought to have evolved from a smaller species, the brown bear, about 150,000 years ago. How did it evolve its adaptations for life in the Arctic? Let's consider just one of the adaptations, the thick white fur.

There are two main selection pressures in favour of thick white fur. The first is the need for insulation to reduce heat loss. The polar bear often has to survive temperatures of -30°C, and temperatures in the Arctic can fall as low as -70°C. The second is camouflage; white fur camouflages the animal against the snow so that it can approach its prey unseen and then attack it.

Among the brown bears that were the ancestors of the polar bear there would have been variations in fur length and colour. When some of these bears came to live in colder, more northerly habitats, those individuals with longer and paler fur would have had a selective advantage over others with shorter, darker fur. Any gene mutations that produced long, pale fur increased this advantage. Bears with these genes were less likely to die from the cold, or from lack of food. As a result, well-adapted bears were more likely to reproduce and pass on their genes. Over many thousands of years more mutations and selection for long, white fur produced the adaptation we see in the polar bear today. The same process of natural selection is thought to have happened to bring about the other adaptations shown by the polar bear.

### DID YOU KNOW?

Polar bear fur appears to be white, but in fact the individual hairs are actually transparent. The white colour results from light being refracted through the clear hair strands.

### CAN WE OBSERVE NATURAL SELECTION IN ACTION?

Most animals and plants reproduce slowly, so it takes a long time for natural selection to have an observable effect. To observe natural selection happening we can study organisms that reproduce quickly, such as bacteria or insects.

## ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE IN BACTERIA

Antibiotics are chemicals that kill or reduce the growth of microorganisms (Figure 19.6). They are used in medicine mainly to treat bacterial infections, although a few antibiotics are effective against fungal pathogens. Antibiotics do not work on viruses, so they are no use in treating any disease caused by a virus.

Natural antibiotics are produced by bacteria and fungi. They give a microorganism an advantage over other microorganisms when competing for nutrients and other resources, since the antibiotic kills the competing organisms.

Alexander Fleming discovered the first antibiotic in 1929. It is made by the mould Penicillium, and is called penicillin. Penicillin kills bacteria, and was first used to treat bacterial infections in the 1940s. Since then other natural antibiotics have been discovered, and many more have been chemically synthesised in laboratories. The use of antibiotics has increased dramatically, particularly over the last 20 years. We now almost expect to be given an antibiotic for even the most minor of ailments. This can be dangerous, as it leads to the development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, so that the antibiotics are no longer effective in preventing bacterial infection.

Figure 19.6 This photo shows a colony of bacteria growing on a petri dish of nutrient agar. The circular discs contain different antibiotics. The discs have clear areas around them, where the bacteria have been killed by the antibiotic diffusing out from the discs.

### DID YOU KNOW?

A particularly worrying example of a resistant bacterium is MRSA. MRSA stands for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. It is sometimes called a 'super bug' because it is resistant to many antibiotics including methicillin (a type of penicillin). It is a particular problem in hospitals where it is responsible for many difficult-to-treat infections.

Resistance starts when a random mutation gives a bacterium resistance to a particular antibiotic. In a situation where the antibiotic is widely used, the new resistant bacterium has an advantage over non-resistant bacteria of the same type. The resistant strain of bacterium will survive and multiply in greater numbers than the non-resistant type. Bacteria reproduce very quickly – the generation time of a bacterium (the time it takes to divide into two daughter cells) can be as short as 20 minutes. This means that there could be 72 generations in a single day, producing a population of millions of resistant bacteria.

Resistant bacteria will not be killed by the antibiotic, meaning the antibiotic is no longer effective in controlling the disease.

Bacterial resistance to antibiotics was first noticed in hospitals in the 1950s, and has grown to be a major problem today. The resistant bacteria have a selective advantage over non-resistant bacteria – they are 'fitter'. In effect, the bacteria have evolved as a result of natural selection.

Doctors are now more reluctant to prescribe antibiotics. They know that by using them less, the bacteria with resistance have less of an advantage and will not become as widespread.

### HINT

Some people talk about bacteria becoming immune to antibiotics. This is a misunderstanding. Immunity happens in people – we become immune to microorganisms that infect us, as a result of the immune response. Bacteria become resistant to antibiotics.

## PESTICIDE RESISTANCE IN INSECTS

Just as pathogenic bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics, insect pests can develop resistance to insecticides. The powerful insecticide DDT was first used in the 1940s (see Chapter 15). By the 1950s many species of insect (e.g. mosquitoes) appeared to be resistant to DDT. The resistant insects had developed a gene mutation that stopped them being killed by the insecticide.
---
While DDT continued to be used, the resistant insects had a selective advantage over the non-resistant ones. They survived to breed, so that with each generation the numbers of resistant insects in the population increased.

The same thing has happened with modern insecticides. There are now hundreds of examples of insect pests that have developed resistance to different insecticides.

## SELECTIVE BREEDING

About 12000 years ago, the human way of life changed significantly. Humans began to grow plants and keep animals for milk and meat. They became farmers rather than hunters. This change first took place in the Middle East. Similar changes took place a little later in the Americas (where potatoes and maize were being grown) and in the Far East (where rice was first cultivated).

In the Middle East, humans first grew the cereal plants wheat and barley, and kept sheep and goats. Later, their livestock included cattle and pigs. Cultivating crops and keeping stock animals made it possible for permanent settlements to appear – life in villages began. Because of the more certain food supply, there was spare time, for the first time ever, for some people to do things other than hunt for food.

Ever since the cultivation of the first wheat and barley and the domestication of the first stock animals, humans have tried to obtain bigger yields from them. They cross-bred different maize plants (and barley plants) to obtain strains that produced more grain. They bred sheep and goats to give more milk and meat – selective breeding had begun. Today, animals and plants are bred for more than just food. For example, animals are used to produce a range of medicines and for research into the action of drugs.

Selective breeding is best described as the breeding of only those individuals with desirable features. It is sometimes called 'artificial selection', as human choice, rather than environmental factors, is providing the selection pressure (compare this with natural selection, described above).

The methods used today for selective breeding are very different from those used only 50 years ago. Modern gene technology makes it possible to create a new strain of plant within weeks, rather than years.

## TRADITIONAL SELECTIVE BREEDING

### PLANTS

Traditionally, farmers have bred crop plants of all kinds to obtain increased yields. Probably the earliest example of selective breeding was the cross-breeding of strains of wild wheat. The aim was to produce wheat with a much increased yield of grain and with shorter, stronger stems (Figure 19.7). This wheat was used to make bread.

| Stage | Description | Wheat Type |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | About 11,000 years ago, two strains of wild wheat were cultivated by farmers. Initially, all attempts at cross-breeding to produce wheats with a better yield gave only sterile offspring. | Triticum monococcum (wild einkorn wheat) - unknown wild wheat |
| 2 | About 8000 years ago, a fertile hybrid wheat appeared from these two wild wheats. This was called emmer wheat and had a much higher yield than either of the original wheats. | Fertile hybrid wheat - Triticum turgidum (wild emmer wheat) |
| 3 | The emmer wheat was cross-bred with another wild wheat to produce wheat very similar to the wheats used today to make bread. This new wheat had an even bigger yield and was much easier to 'process' to make flour. | Triticum aestivum (bread wheat) |

Figure 19.7 Modern wheat is the result of selective breeding by early farmers.

## VARIATION AND SELECTION

### NATURAL SELECTION, EVOLUTION AND SELECTIVE BREEDING

**DID YOU KNOW?**
The production of modern bread wheats by selective breeding is probably one of the earliest examples of producing genetically modified food. Each original wild wheat species had 14 chromosomes per cell. The wild emmer hybrid had 28 chromosomes per cell. Modern bread wheat has 42 chromosomes per cell. Selective breeding has modified the genetic make-up of wheat.

Other plants have been selectively bred for certain characteristics. Brassica is a genus of cabbage-like plants. One species of wild brassica (Brassica olera) was selectively bred to give several strains, each with specific features (see Figure 19.8). Some of the strains had large leaves, others had large flower heads, and others produced large buds.

| Original Wild Brassica | Selectively Bred Varieties |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Central plant          | Brussels sprouts (lateral buds) |
|                        | Cabbage (terminal bud) |
|                        | Cauliflower (flower cluster) |
|                        | Broccoli (flowers and stems) |
|                        | Kohlrabi (stem) |
|                        | Kale (leaves) |

Figure 19.8 Selectively breeding the original wild brassica plants to enhance certain features has produced several familiar vegetables.

Selective breeding has produced many familiar vegetables. Besides the ones produced from Brassica, selective breeding of wild Solanum plants has produced the many strains of potatoes that are eaten today. Carrots and parsnips are also the result of selective breeding programmes. Crop plants are bred to produce strains that:

- give higher yields
- are resistant to certain diseases (the diseases would reduce the yields)
- are resistant to certain insect pest damage (the damage would reduce the yield)
- are hardier (so that they survive in harsher climates or are productive for longer periods of the year)
- have a better balance of nutrients in the crop (for example, plants that contain more of the types of amino acids needed by humans).

Figure 19.9 shows a field of potato plants. Some have been bred to be resistant to insect pests, while others were not selectively bred in this way.

### DID YOU KNOW?
Plant breeders do not just breed plants for food. Nearly all garden flowers are the result of selective breeding. Breeders have selected flowers to have a particular size, shape, colour and fragrance. Roses and orchids are among the most selectively bred of our garden plants.

Figure 19.9 Selective breeding can reduce damage by pests. The plants on the right have been bred to be resistant to a fungal pest. Plants on the left are not resistant to the pest.

### ANIMALS

Farmers have bred stock animals for similar reasons to the breeding of crops. They have selected for animals that:

- produce more meat, milk or eggs
- produce more fur or better quality fur
- produce more offspring
- show increased resistance to diseases and parasites.

Again, like crop breeding, breeding animals for increased productivity has been practised for thousands of years. A stone tablet found in Iran appears to record the results of breeding domesticated donkeys. It was dated at over 5000 years old.

For many thousands of years, the only way to improve livestock was to mate a male and a female with the features that were desired in the offspring. In cattle, milk yield is an important factor and so high-yielding cows would be bred with bulls from other high-yielding cows.

Since about 1950, the technique of artificial insemination (AI) has become widely available. Bulls with many desirable features are kept and semen is obtained from them. The semen is diluted, frozen and stored. Farmers can buy quantities of this semen to inseminate their cows. The semen is transferred into the cow's uterus using a syringe. AI makes it possible for the semen from one prize bull to be used to fertilise many thousands of cows.

Modern sheep are domesticated wild sheep, and cows have been derived from wild aurochs. Just think of all the varieties of dogs that now exist. All these have been derived from one ancestral type. This original 'dog' was a domesticated wolf (Figure 19.10). In domesticating the wolf, humans gained an animal that
---

was capable of herding stock animals. The sheepdog has all the same instincts as the wolf except the instinct to kill. This has been selectively 'bred out'.

![Figure 19.10 The many different breeds of dog all originate from a common ancestor – the wolf.]
