# VARIATION AND SELECTION: NATURAL SELECTION, EVOLUTION, AND SELECTIVE BREEDING

## INTRODUCTION
OVER MILLIONS OF YEARS, LIFE ON EARTH HAS EVOLVED FROM SIMPLE ORGANISMS INTO A VAST ARRAY OF DIVERSE SPECIES. THIS PROCESS IS KNOWN AS NATURAL SELECTION. IN THIS CHAPTER, WE WILL EXPLORE THE MECHANISMS BEHIND THIS EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS, INCLUDING TRADITIONAL METHODS OF SELECTIVE BREEDING AND MODERN DEVELOPMENTS INVOLVING CLONED ORGANISMS.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES
BY THE END OF THIS CHAPTER, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO:
- EXPLAIN DARWIN'S THEORY OF EVOLUTION BY NATURAL SELECTION.
- UNDERSTAND HOW RESISTANCE TO ANTIBIOTICS CAN INCREASE IN BACTERIAL POPULATIONS.
- DESCRIBE HOW SELECTIVE BREEDING CAN BE USED TO PRODUCE PLANTS WITH DESIRED CHARACTERISTICS.
- EXPLAIN HOW SELECTIVE BREEDING CAN BE USED TO PRODUCE ANIMALS WITH DESIRABLE CHARACTERISTICS.

## UNDERSTANDING EVOLUTION
THE TERM "EVOLUTION" REFERS TO THE IDEA THAT SPECIES ARE NOT FIXED IN THEIR FORM BUT CHANGE OVER TIME. THIS CONCEPT HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS, WITH MANY SCIENTISTS AND PHILOSOPHERS DISCUSSING IT. BY THE EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY, WHILE THE IDEA OF EVOLUTION WAS ACCEPTED, THE MECHANISM BEHIND IT REMAINED UNCLEAR.

## THE WORK OF CHARLES DARWIN
THE ENGLISH BIOLOGIST **CHARLES DARWIN** (1809-1882) PROPOSED THE WIDELY ACCEPTED MECHANISM FOR EVOLUTION: NATURAL SELECTION. DESPITE INITIAL DOUBTS ABOUT HIS ACADEMIC PROSPECTS, DARWIN BECAME ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL SCIENTISTS IN HISTORY. AT AGE 22, HE JOINED THE HMS BEAGLE AS A NATURALIST, EMBARKING ON A FIVE-YEAR VOYAGE THAT WOULD LEAD TO HIS GROUNDBREAKING THEORY.

## CONCLUSION
THIS CHAPTER DELVES INTO THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL SELECTION AND THEIR APPLICATIONS IN BOTH EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY AND SELECTIVE BREEDING PRACTICES. UNDERSTANDING THESE CONCEPTS IS ESSENTIAL FOR GRASPING THE MECHANISMS THAT DRIVE BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION

## NATURAL SELECTION, EVOLUTION, AND SELECTIVE BREEDING

DURING HIS VOYAGE ON HMS BEAGLE, CHARLES DARWIN COLLECTED NUMEROUS BIOLOGICAL SPECIMENS AND OBSERVED DIVERSE LIFE FORMS ACROSS SOUTH AMERICA AND THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS. HIS OBSERVATIONS LED HIM TO HYPOTHESIZE THAT SPECIES EVOLVE THROUGH NATURAL SELECTION.

### DARWIN'S INFLUENCES
DARWIN WAS INSPIRED BY GEOLOGIST CHARLES LYELL, WHO SUGGESTED THAT EARTH'S GEOLOGICAL LAYERS CHANGE OVER TIME. DARWIN NOTED THAT FOSSILS IN SUCCESSIVE ROCK LAYERS EXHIBITED GRADUAL CHANGES, HINTING AT EVOLUTIONARY PROCESSES.

### KEY OBSERVATIONS
UPON RETURNING TO ENGLAND, DARWIN ANALYZED HIS DATA AND PROPOSED THE CONCEPT OF NATURAL SELECTION THROUGH SEVERAL ESSAYS:

1. ORGANISMS OFTEN PRODUCE MORE OFFSPRING THAN NECESSARY FOR POPULATION REPLACEMENT. FOR INSTANCE, A FEMALE SALMON RELEASES MILLIONS OF EGGS ANNUALLY, WHILE A PUFFBALL FUNGUS PRODUCES VAST NUMBERS OF SPORES.
2. DESPITE HIGH PRODUCTION, POPULATIONS REMAIN STABLE, INDICATING RESOURCE COMPETITION AND MORTALITY.
3. VARIABILITY EXISTS WITHIN SPECIES; NOT ALL INDIVIDUALS ARE IDENTICAL.

### DEDUCTIONS FROM OBSERVATIONS
FROM THESE INSIGHTS, DARWIN DEDUCED TWO CRITICAL IDEAS:

1. **THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE**: HIGH OFFSPRING PRODUCTION SUGGESTS INTENSE COMPETITION, WHERE MANY INDIVIDUALS PERISH, ENSURING ONLY THE MOST SUITED SURVIVE.
2. **SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST**: ORGANISMS BEST ADAPTED TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT ARE MORE LIKELY TO REPRODUCE, PASSING ADVANTAGEOUS TRAITS TO FUTURE GENERATIONS.

### UNDERSTANDING SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST
THE TERM "SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST" REFERS TO BIOLOGICAL FITNESS, DETERMINED BY AN ORGANISM'S ABILITY TO ADAPT AND SUCCEED IN REPRODUCTION. TRAITS ENHANCING SURVIVAL ARE FAVORED OVER LESS SUITED ONES.

### DARWIN'S IMPACTFUL WORK
ALFRED RUSSEL WALLACE INDEPENDENTLY REACHED SIMILAR EVOLUTIONARY CONCLUSIONS AS DARWIN. TOGETHER, THEY COAUTHORED A PAPER, BUT DARWIN EXPANDED THESE IDEAS IN HIS 1859 BOOK, *ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES*. HIS HYPOTHESIS THAT HUMANS EVOLVED FROM APE-LIKE ANCESTORS FACED INITIAL RIDICULE BUT FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORMED BIOLOGY.

### FIGURE 19.3
DARWIN'S WORK INITIALLY FACED OPPOSITION, WITH MANY MOCKING HIS THEORIES. HOWEVER, HIS CONTRIBUTIONS HAVE PROFOUNDLY INFLUENCED MODERN BIOLOGY, INCLUDING PLANT TROPISMS AS DISCUSSED IN CHAPTER 12.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION: NATURAL SELECTION, EVOLUTION, AND SELECTIVE BREEDING

## KEY POINTS
- NATURAL SELECTION DETERMINES WHICH FORMS OF A SPECIES SURVIVE AND REPRODUCE BASED ON ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS.
- GREGOR MENDEL'S WORK ON INHERITANCE AND GENES, CRUCIAL FOR UNDERSTANDING VARIATION, WAS RECOGNIZED ONLY IN 1903.

## UNDERSTANDING NATURAL SELECTION
THE THEORY OF NATURAL SELECTION POSITS THAT CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS 'SELECT' WHICH FORMS OF A SPECIES WILL SURVIVE TO REPRODUCE. THE PROCESS UNFOLDS AS FOLLOWS:

1. **VARIATION WITHIN THE SPECIES**: INDIVIDUALS IN A SPECIES EXHIBIT NATURAL VARIATION.
2. **SELECTION PRESSURE**: ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES FAVOR PARTICULAR FORMS OF THE SPECIES, PROVIDING A SELECTIVE ADVANTAGE.
3. **SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST**: THE FREQUENCY OF FAVORED FORMS INCREASES, WHILE LESS ADAPTED FORMS DECREASE IN FREQUENCY.
4. **GENE MUTATIONS**: WHILE MANY GENE MUTATIONS ARE HARMFUL AND LEAD TO ORGANISMAL DEATH, SOME ARE NEUTRAL AND CAN BE PASSED ON. BENEFICIAL MUTATIONS PROVIDE RAW MATERIAL FOR NEW INHERITED VARIATION.

## EXAMPLE OF NATURAL SELECTION: THE HOVERFLY

### MIMICRY
WASPS POSSESS A STING AND EXHIBIT YELLOW AND BLACK STRIPES KNOWN AS 'WARNING COLORATION.' PREDATORS, SUCH AS BIRDS, LEARN TO ASSOCIATE THESE COLORS WITH DANGER, AVOIDING ATTACKS. HOVERFLIES, LACKING A STING, HAVE EVOLVED TO MIMIC WASPS' APPEARANCE, GAINING SIMILAR STRIPES. THIS MIMICRY OFFERS A SURVIVAL ADVANTAGE AS PREDATORS TREAT HOVERFLIES AS DANGEROUS.

### EVOLUTION OF THE HOVERFLY'S APPEARANCE
THE EVOLUTION OF HOVERFLIES' APPEARANCE CAN BE EXPLAINED THROUGH NATURAL SELECTION:

- **SELECTION PRESSURE**: PREDATION BY BIRDS AND OTHER ANIMALS CREATED PRESSURE FAVORING STRIPED HOVERFLIES.
- **VARIATION**: ANCESTOR HOVERFLIES EXHIBITED VARIATION IN COLORATION DUE TO MUTATIONS.
- **SELECTIVE ADVANTAGE**: STRIPED HOVERFLIES WERE LESS LIKELY TO BE EATEN, PROVIDING A SURVIVAL ADVANTAGE.
- **REPRODUCTION**: SURVIVING HOVERFLIES PASSED ON GENES FOR STRIPES TO OFFSPRING.

OVER GENERATIONS, THIS PROCESS LED TO THE EVOLUTION OF EFFECTIVE WARNING COLORATION. EVEN SLIGHT STRIATIONS PROVIDED AN INITIAL ADVANTAGE, LEADING TO INCREASED STRIPED POPULATIONS OVER TIME.

### KEY POINT
PERFECT STRIPES DID NOT NEED IMMEDIATE APPEARANCE. SLIGHT STRIATIONS OFFERED A SELECTIVE ADVANTAGE, CONTRIBUTING TO THE POPULATION'S SHIFT TOWARD STRIPED HOVERFLIES.

THIS OVERVIEW ILLUSTRATES NATURAL SELECTION'S PRINCIPLES AND THE ROLE OF GENETIC VARIATION IN SPECIES SURVIVAL.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION: NATURAL SELECTION, EVOLUTION, AND SELECTIVE BREEDING

## THE POLAR BEAR

THE POLAR BEAR IS A LARGE PREDATORY CARNIVORE NATIVE TO THE ARCTIC, WHERE IT THRIVES ON LANDMASSES AND SEA ICE WITHIN THE ARCTIC CIRCLE. ITS PRIMARY DIET CONSISTS OF SEALS, WHICH IT HUNTS USING TECHNIQUES SUCH AS WAITING NEAR ICE HOLES WHERE SEALS SURFACE TO BREATHE AND SILENTLY APPROACHING SEALS RESTING ON THE ICE.

### ADAPTATIONS OF THE POLAR BEAR

POLAR BEARS POSSESS NUMEROUS ADAPTATIONS THAT ENABLE THEM TO SURVIVE IN THEIR HARSH ENVIRONMENT. THESE INCLUDE:

- A THICK LAYER OF WHITE FUR THAT REDUCES HEAT LOSS AND PROVIDES CAMOUFLAGE IN SNOWY CONDITIONS.
- LARGE, WIDE PAWS THAT ENHANCE STABILITY BOTH ON LAND AND WHILE SWIMMING.
- STRONG, MUSCULAR LEGS ENABLING CONTINUOUS SWIMMING IN COLD ARCTIC WATERS.
- NOSTRILS THAT CLOSE UNDERWATER, ALLOWING THEM TO SWIM WITHOUT INHALING WATER.
- A LARGE BODY MASS, TYPICALLY BETWEEN 350 TO 550 KILOGRAMS FOR ADULT MALES, WHICH REDUCES HEAT LOSS THROUGH A FAVORABLE SURFACE AREA-TO-VOLUME RATIO.
- A 10-CENTIMETER THICK LAYER OF FAT INSULATION UNDER THE SKIN.
- A WELL-DEVELOPED SENSE OF SMELL FOR DETECTING PREY FROM DISTANCES.
- BUMPS ON PAW PADS THAT PROVIDE TRACTION ON ICY SURFACES.
- SHORT, POWERFUL CLAWS ESSENTIAL FOR GRIPPING AND HOLDING HEAVY PREY.

### EVOLUTIONARY ADAPTATIONS

THE POLAR BEAR'S EVOLUTION FROM A SMALLER BROWN BEAR ANCESTOR INVOLVED SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS TO ARCTIC LIFE. THESE INCLUDED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THICK WHITE FUR, WHICH FACED TWO KEY EVOLUTIONARY PRESSURES: INSULATION AGAINST EXTREME COLD AND CAMOUFLAGE IN SNOWY ENVIRONMENTS.

AMONG BROWN BEARS, THOSE WITH LONGER AND PALER FUR HAD A SELECTIVE ADVANTAGE IN COLDER NORTHERN HABITATS. THESE TRAITS ALLOWED THEM TO SURVIVE HARSH CONDITIONS, LEADING TO HIGHER REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS, NATURAL SELECTION FAVORED THESE ADAPTIVE TRAITS, RESULTING IN THE WELL-SUITED POLAR BEAR.

### OBSERVING NATURAL SELECTION

NATURAL SELECTION OFTEN OCCURS OVER LONG TIMESCALES, MAKING DIRECT OBSERVATION CHALLENGING IN SLOW-REPRODUCING SPECIES LIKE POLAR BEARS. HOWEVER, STUDYING FAST-REPRODUCING ORGANISMS SUCH AS BACTERIA OR INSECTS PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO EVOLUTIONARY PROCESSES. THESE STUDIES HELP SCIENTISTS UNDERSTAND HOW NATURAL SELECTION SHAPES SPECIES, INCLUDING THE POLAR BEAR'S EVOLUTION.

THIS REFORMATTING MAINTAINS A CLEAR, HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE WHILE ELIMINATING UNNECESSARY ELEMENTS, ENSURING FACTUAL CONTENT AND A SCIENTIFIC TONE WITHOUT READER-DIRECTED LANGUAGE.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION: ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE IN BACTERIA

## UNDERSTANDING ANTIBIOTICS

ANTIBIOTICS ARE CHEMICALS THAT KILL OR INHIBIT THE GROWTH OF MICROORGANISMS. THEY ARE PRIMARILY USED TO TREAT BACTERIAL INFECTIONS BUT ARE INEFFECTIVE AGAINST VIRUSES. THE FIRST ANTIBIOTIC, PENICILLIN, WAS DISCOVERED IN 1929 FROM THE MOULD *PENICILLIUM*. IT BECAME WIDELY USED IN THE 1940S, LEADING TO THE DISCOVERY OF MANY NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC ANTIBIOTICS.

## THE RISE OF ANTIBIOTIC USE

THE USE OF ANTIBIOTICS HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY, ESPECIALLY OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS. OVERUSE CAN BE DANGEROUS AS PEOPLE OFTEN EXPECT ANTIBIOTICS FOR MINOR AILMENTS. THIS PRACTICE CONTRIBUTES TO BACTERIAL RESISTANCE, MAKING ANTIBIOTICS INEFFECTIVE AGAINST CERTAIN INFECTIONS.

## ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE

### HOW RESISTANCE DEVELOPS

RESISTANCE BEGINS WITH A RANDOM MUTATION IN BACTERIA, GRANTING THEM RESISTANCE TO SPECIFIC ANTIBIOTICS. IN ENVIRONMENTS WHERE ANTIBIOTICS ARE WIDELY USED, RESISTANT BACTERIA HAVE A SURVIVAL ADVANTAGE. BACTERIA REPRODUCE RAPIDLY, WITH A GENERATION TIME AS SHORT AS 20 MINUTES, LEADING TO THE RAPID SPREAD OF RESISTANT STRAINS.

### THE CONSEQUENCES OF RESISTANCE

ONCE BACTERIA DEVELOP RESISTANCE, ANTIBIOTICS LOSE EFFECTIVENESS. THIS ISSUE WAS FIRST NOTED IN HOSPITALS IN THE 1950S AND HAS SINCE BECOME A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM. RESISTANT BACTERIA GAIN A SELECTIVE ADVANTAGE, ENHANCING THEIR SURVIVAL AND REPRODUCTION.

### THE CASE OF MRSA

A NOTABLE EXAMPLE IS MRSA (*METHICILLIN-RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS*), OFTEN CALLED A "SUPERBUG." IT IS RESISTANT TO MANY ANTIBIOTICS, INCLUDING METHICILLIN, POSING CHALLENGES IN HOSPITALS WHERE IT CAUSES DIFFICULT-TO-TREAT INFECTIONS.

### CHANGING PRESCRIBING PRACTICES

TO COMBAT RESISTANCE, DOCTORS NOW PRESCRIBE ANTIBIOTICS CAUTIOUSLY. REDUCED USE HELPS DIMINISH THE SELECTIVE ADVANTAGE OF RESISTANT BACTERIA, SLOWING THEIR SPREAD.

## PESTICIDE RESISTANCE IN INSECTS

SIMILAR TO BACTERIA, INSECT PESTS CAN DEVELOP RESISTANCE TO INSECTICIDES. FOR EXAMPLE, DDT, FIRST USED IN THE 1940S, LED TO MOSQUITO RESISTANCE BY THE 1950S DUE TO GENE MUTATIONS ALLOWING SURVIVAL AGAINST THE INSECTICIDE.

### FIGURE 19.6

THIS PHOTO SHOWS A COLONY OF BACTERIA ON NUTRIENT AGAR WITH ANTIBIOTIC DISCS. CLEAR AREAS AROUND THE DISCS INDICATE BACTERIAL DEATH FROM ANTIBIOTIC DIFFUSION.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION

## NATURAL SELECTION, EVOLUTION, AND SELECTIVE BREEDING

### NATURAL SELECTION AND INSECT RESISTANCE
THE CONCEPT OF NATURAL SELECTION IS ILLUSTRATED THROUGH THE USE OF DDT, A PESTICIDE WIDELY USED IN AGRICULTURE. WHILE DDT CONTINUED TO BE APPLIED, CERTAIN INSECTS DEVELOPED RESISTANCE, GIVING THEM A SURVIVAL ADVANTAGE. THESE RESISTANT INSECTS THRIVED AND REPRODUCED, LEADING TO AN INCREASE IN THEIR POPULATION. THIS PHENOMENON HAS BEEN OBSERVED WITH MODERN INSECTICIDES, RESULTING IN NUMEROUS EXAMPLES OF INSECT PESTS DEVELOPING RESISTANCE.

### SELECTIVE BREEDING
APPROXIMATELY 12,000 YEARS AGO, HUMANS TRANSITIONED FROM HUNTING TO FARMING, BEGINNING IN THE MIDDLE EAST. EARLY HUMANS CULTIVATED CEREAL PLANTS LIKE WHEAT AND BARLEY, AND DOMESTICATED ANIMALS SUCH AS SHEEP AND GOATS. THIS SHIFT ALLOWED FOR PERMANENT SETTLEMENTS AND VILLAGES, FREEING TIME FOR OTHER ACTIVITIES.

#### THE ORIGINS OF SELECTIVE BREEDING
FROM THE ONSET OF AGRICULTURE, HUMANS HAVE SOUGHT TO ENHANCE CROP YIELDS AND LIVESTOCK PRODUCTIVITY. EARLY FARMERS CROSS-BRED DIFFERENT MAIZE AND BARLEY STRAINS TO PRODUCE HIGHER-YIELDING VARIETIES. THEY ALSO BRED SHEEP AND GOATS FOR INCREASED MILK AND MEAT PRODUCTION. THIS PRACTICE, KNOWN AS ARTIFICIAL SELECTION, CONTRASTS WITH NATURAL SELECTION, WHERE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS DRIVE THE PROCESS.

### TRADITIONAL SELECTIVE BREEDING IN PLANTS
FARMERS HAVE TRADITIONALLY USED SELECTIVE BREEDING TO IMPROVE CROP YIELDS. ONE OF THE EARLIEST EXAMPLES INVOLVED CROSS-BREEDING WILD WHEAT STRAINS. INITIAL ATTEMPTS RESULTED IN STERILE OFFSPRING, BUT AROUND 8,000 YEARS AGO, A FERTILE HYBRID KNOWN AS EMMER WHEAT EMERGED. THIS HYBRID, DERIVED FROM TRITICUM MONOCOCCUM AND TRITICUM TURGIDUM, HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER YIELD AND EASIER PROCESSING INTO FLOUR, LEADING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN BREAD WHEAT, TRITICUM AESTIVUM.

### MODERN ADVANCES IN SELECTIVE BREEDING
TODAY, SELECTIVE BREEDING METHODS HAVE EVOLVED RAPIDLY. MODERN GENE TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS FOR RAPID CREATION OF NEW PLANT STRAINS, EXPANDING APPLICATIONS BEYOND FOOD PRODUCTION TO INCLUDE MEDICINAL PURPOSES AND RESEARCH. THIS ADVANCEMENT CONTINUES TO IMPACT INDUSTRIES RELIANT ON GENETIC SELECTION.

## CONCLUSION
SELECTIVE BREEDING HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED AGRICULTURE, ENABLING HUMANS TO CULTIVATE PLANTS AND ANIMALS THAT MEET THEIR NEEDS. AS GENETIC TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES, THE POTENTIAL FOR SELECTIVE BREEDING WILL GROW, IMPACTING FOOD PRODUCTION AND OTHER INDUSTRIES IN UNFORESEEN WAYS.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION

## NATURAL SELECTION, EVOLUTION, AND SELECTIVE BREEDING

THE PRODUCTION OF MODERN BREAD WHEATS THROUGH SELECTIVE BREEDING REPRESENTS ONE OF THE EARLIEST EXAMPLES OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD. WILD WHEAT SPECIES ORIGINALLY HAD 14 CHROMOSOMES PER CELL, WHILE THE WILD EMMER HYBRID CONTAINED 28 CHROMOSOMES. MODERN BREAD WHEAT HAS EVOLVED TO POSSESS 42 CHROMOSOMES PER CELL, ILLUSTRATING SIGNIFICANT GENETIC ALTERATIONS ACHIEVED THROUGH SELECTIVE BREEDING.

## SELECTIVE BREEDING OF PLANTS

SELECTIVE BREEDING HAS BEEN EMPLOYED TO ENHANCE SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS IN VARIOUS PLANT GENERA. THE GENUS *BRASSICA* INCLUDES SEVERAL CABBAGE-LIKE PLANTS, WITH *BRASSICA OLERACEA* BEING SELECTIVELY BRED INTO DISTINCT STRAINS, EACH SHOWCASING UNIQUE FEATURES.

### FIGURE 19.8: SELECTIVELY BRED BRASSICA PLANTS
- **CABBAGE**: TERMINAL BUD
- **CAULIFLOWER**: FLOWER CLUSTER
- **BROCCOLI**: FLOWERS AND STEMS
- **BRUSSELS SPROUTS**: LATERAL BUDS
- **KOHLRABI**: STEM
- **KALE**: LEAVES

THESE SELECTIVE BREEDING EFFORTS HAVE LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NUMEROUS FAMILIAR VEGETABLES. ADDITIONALLY, WILD *SOLANUM* PLANTS HAVE BEEN SELECTIVELY BRED TO PRODUCE THE DIVERSE POTATO STRAINS CONSUMED TODAY. CARROTS AND PARSNIPS ARE ALSO PRODUCTS OF SELECTIVE BREEDING PROGRAMS.

## GOALS OF SELECTIVE BREEDING

CROP PLANTS ARE BRED FOR SEVERAL OBJECTIVES:
- **HIGHER YIELDS**: INCREASING FOOD PRODUCTION PER PLANT.
- **DISEASE RESISTANCE**: DEVELOPING PLANTS THAT WITHSTAND DISEASES AFFECTING YIELD.
- **INSECT PEST RESISTANCE**: CREATING PLANTS LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO PEST DAMAGE.
- **HARDINESS**: ENSURING PLANTS SURVIVE IN HARSH CONDITIONS OR MAINTAIN PRODUCTIVITY OVER EXTENDED PERIODS.
- **NUTRITIONAL BALANCE**: ENHANCING NUTRIENT CONTENT, SUCH AS INCREASING ESSENTIAL AMINO ACIDS BENEFICIAL FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION.

THROUGH THESE METHODS, SELECTIVE BREEDING CONTINUES TO PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN AGRICULTURE AND FOOD PRODUCTION.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION: NATURAL SELECTION, EVOLUTION, AND SELECTIVE BREEDING

## SELECTIVE BREEDING IN PLANTS
SELECTIVE BREEDING HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED PLANT EVOLUTION, PARTICULARLY IN FOOD CROPS AND GARDEN FLOWERS. BREEDERS SELECT PLANTS BASED ON TRAITS SUCH AS SIZE, SHAPE, COLOR, AND FRAGRANCE. ROSES AND ORCHIDS ARE NOTABLE EXAMPLES OF SELECTIVELY BRED GARDEN FLOWERS.

## SELECTIVE BREEDING IN ANIMALS
FARMERS HAVE APPLIED SELECTIVE BREEDING TECHNIQUES TO LIVESTOCK FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. THIS PROCESS FOCUSES ON ENHANCING PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH TRAITS LIKE:

- PRODUCING MORE MEAT, MILK, OR EGGS
- GENERATING MORE FUR OR BETTER QUALITY FUR
- INCREASING OFFSPRING PRODUCTION
- ENHANCING RESISTANCE TO DISEASES AND PARASITES

IN CATTLE BREEDING, HIGH-YIELDING COWS ARE PAIRED WITH BULLS FROM OTHER HIGH-YIELDING HERDS TO MAXIMIZE MILK PRODUCTION.

## ADVANCES IN BREEDING TECHNIQUES
ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION (AI) HAS REVOLUTIONIZED ANIMAL BREEDING SINCE THE MID-20TH CENTURY. THIS METHOD INVOLVES:

1. COLLECTING SEMEN FROM BULLS WITH DESIRABLE TRAITS.
2. DILUTING, FREEZING, AND STORING THE SEMEN.
3. USING A SYRINGE TO TRANSFER THE SEMEN INTO THE COW'S UTERUS.

THIS TECHNIQUE INCREASES GENETIC DIVERSITY AND PRODUCTIVITY IN LIVESTOCK POPULATIONS.

## THE EVOLUTION OF DOMESTICATED ANIMALS
MODERN SHEEP DESCEND FROM WILD SHEEP, WHILE COWS EVOLVED FROM WILD AUROCHS. DOGS, TOO, HAVE DIVERSE BREEDS ALL TRACEABLE BACK TO A SINGLE ANCESTRAL DOMESTICATED WOLF. SELECTIVE BREEDING HAS SHAPED THESE ANIMALS INTO USEFUL FORMS, ILLUSTRATING HUMAN INTERVENTION'S ROLE IN EVOLUTION.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION

## CHAPTER QUESTIONS

### SKILLS AND CRITICAL THINKING

NATURAL SELECTION IS A KEY CONCEPT IN EVOLUTION WHERE CERTAIN TRAITS BECOME MORE OR LESS COMMON BASED ON THEIR IMPACT ON SURVIVAL AND REPRODUCTION. THIS PROCESS CAN BE OBSERVED IN THE DOMESTICATION OF DOGS, WHICH ALL TRACE THEIR ORIGINS TO A SINGLE ANCESTOR—THE WOLF. THROUGH SELECTIVE BREEDING, SPECIFIC TRAITS HAVE BEEN EITHER ENHANCED OR DIMINISHED. FOR INSTANCE, THE INSTINCT TO KILL HAS BEEN SELECTIVELY BRED OUT IN SHEEPDOGS.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION

## KEY CONCEPTS

### NATURAL SELECTION
NATURAL SELECTION IS A PROCESS WHERE ORGANISMS BETTER ADAPTED TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT TEND TO SURVIVE AND PRODUCE MORE OFFSPRING. THIS PROCESS OFTEN RESULTS IN THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.

### ARTIFICIAL SELECTION
ARTIFICIAL SELECTION, ALSO KNOWN AS SELECTIVE BREEDING, INVOLVES HUMANS INTENTIONALLY SELECTING SPECIFIC TRAITS IN ANIMALS OR PLANTS TO ENHANCE DESIRABLE CHARACTERISTICS.

## CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS

REASONING AND ANALYSIS ARE ESSENTIAL SKILLS FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL SELECTION INFLUENCE BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY. THESE SKILLS ALLOW STUDENTS TO EVALUATE EVIDENCE, DRAW CONCLUSIONS, AND EXPLORE THE IMPLICATIONS OF EVOLUTIONARY PROCESSES.

## CASE STUDIES

### ANTIBIOTICS AND PATHOGENS
ANTIBIOTICS ARE CHEMICALS DESIGNED TO KILL PATHOGENS, WHICH ARE ORGANISMS THAT CAUSE DISEASE. SOME ORGANISMS, SUCH AS CERTAIN FUNGI AND BACTERIA, PRODUCE NATURAL ANTIBIOTICS. OVER TIME, PATHOGENS CAN DEVELOP RESISTANCE TO ANTIBIOTICS THROUGH NATURAL SELECTION. WHEN ANTIBIOTICS ARE USED, SUSCEPTIBLE PATHOGENS ARE ELIMINATED, WHILE RESISTANT ONES SURVIVE AND REPRODUCE, LEADING TO THE DOMINANCE OF RESISTANT POPULATIONS.

### WARFARIN RESISTANCE IN RATS
WARFARIN WAS INITIALLY EFFECTIVE AS A PESTICIDE BUT HAS BECOME LESS EFFECTIVE OVER TIME. THIS IS DUE TO THE SURVIVAL AND REPRODUCTION OF RATS WITH A MUTANT ALLELE CONFERRING RESISTANCE. THE FREQUENCY OF THIS RESISTANCE ALLELE MAY DECLINE IF WARFARIN IS NO LONGER USED, AS NON-RESISTANT RATS WOULD THEN HAVE A SURVIVAL ADVANTAGE.

### DARWIN'S FINCHES
CHARLES DARWIN STUDIED FINCHES IN THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS, PROPOSING THAT THEY EVOLVED FROM A COMMON ANCESTOR. DIFFERENT BEAK SHAPES IN THESE FINCHES REFLECT THEIR DIETARY ADAPTATIONS: SEED-EATING FINCHES HAVE STRONG, THICK BEAKS FOR CRACKING SEEDS, WHILE INSECT-EATING FINCHES HAVE SLENDER, POINTED BEAKS FOR CATCHING INSECTS. THE DIVERSE BEAK TYPES AMONG FINCHES LIKELY AROSE FROM VARIATIONS IN THE ANCESTRAL POPULATION, WITH NATURAL SELECTION FAVORING TRAITS SUITED TO SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTS, LEADING TO THE OBSERVED SPECIES DIVERSITY TODAY.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION

## NATURAL SELECTION, EVOLUTION, AND SELECTIVE BREEDING

### UNDERSTANDING NATURAL SELECTION

NATURAL SELECTION OCCURS WHEN CERTAIN TRAITS PROVIDE INDIVIDUALS WITH A SELECTIVE ADVANTAGE IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT. THIS PROCESS IS INFLUENCED BY SELECTION PRESSURES, WHICH ARE FACTORS THAT AFFECT AN ORGANISM'S ABILITY TO SURVIVE AND REPRODUCE.

**EXAMPLE:** SOME PLANTS IN AREAS CONTAMINATED BY MINING WASTE HAVE DEVELOPED A TOLERANCE TO TOXIC METALS LIKE LEAD AND COPPER. THESE METAL-TOLERANT PLANTS CAN THRIVE IN POLLUTED SOIL, WHILE NON-TOLERANT PLANTS STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE DUE TO THE TOXIC CONDITIONS.

#### QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER:
1. **HOW DID THE NEW TOLERANT VARIETIES OF PLANTS ARISE?**
   - THE NEW TOLERANT VARIETIES LIKELY AROSE THROUGH GENETIC MUTATIONS THAT PROVIDED THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND TOXIC METALS. OVER TIME, THESE TRAITS BECAME MORE COMMON IN THE POPULATION DUE TO NATURAL SELECTION.

2. **EXPLAIN THE FOLLOWING TERMS:**
   - **SELECTION PRESSURE:** A FACTOR THAT INFLUENCES THE SURVIVAL AND REPRODUCTION OF ORGANISMS, SUCH AS ENVIRONMENTAL TOXINS IN THIS CASE.
   - **SELECTIVE ADVANTAGE:** A TRAIT THAT INCREASES AN ORGANISM'S CHANCES OF SURVIVAL AND REPRODUCTION IN A SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENT.
   - **NATURAL SELECTION:** THE PROCESS BY WHICH ORGANISMS BETTER ADAPTED TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT TEND TO SURVIVE AND PRODUCE MORE OFFSPRING.

3. **WHY ARE METAL-TOLERANT PLANTS OUT-COMPETED BY NON-TOLERANT PLANTS IN UNCONTAMINATED SOIL?**
   - IN UNCONTAMINATED SOIL, NON-TOLERANT PLANTS MAY HAVE TRAITS THAT ALLOW THEM TO GROW FASTER OR MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN METAL-TOLERANT PLANTS, GIVING THEM A COMPETITIVE EDGE.

### SELECTIVE BREEDING

SELECTIVE BREEDING IS A HUMAN-DIRECTED PROCESS THAT INVOLVES CHOOSING SPECIFIC PLANTS OR ANIMALS TO REPRODUCE BASED ON DESIRED TRAITS.

#### QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER:
1. **HOW IS SELECTIVE BREEDING SIMILAR TO NATURAL SELECTION?**
   - BOTH PROCESSES INVOLVE THE SELECTION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DESIRABLE TRAITS TO PRODUCE THE NEXT GENERATION.

2. **HOW IS SELECTIVE BREEDING DIFFERENT FROM NATURAL SELECTION?**
   - SELECTIVE BREEDING IS GUIDED BY HUMAN CHOICE, WHILE NATURAL SELECTION OCCURS THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL PRESSURES WITHOUT HUMAN INTERVENTION.

### BREEDING PROGRAMMES

WHEN DESIGNING A BREEDING PROGRAMME, CERTAIN FEATURES ARE IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER. FOR EXAMPLE, IN DAIRY CATTLE, TRAITS SUCH AS MILK YIELD, FEED CONVERSION RATE, GROWTH RATE, AND MEAT TO FAT RATIO MIGHT BE PRIORITIZED.

#### ACTIVITY:
ASSUMING ACCESS TO MODERN SELECTIVE BREEDING TECHNIQUES, DESCRIBE HOW YOU WOULD CREATE A HERD OF HIGH-YIELDING BEEF CATTLE. CONSIDER THE TRAITS SELECTED FOR AND METHODS USED TO ENSURE THESE CHARACTERISTICS ARE PASSED ON TO FUTURE GENERATIONS.

### SKILLS DEVELOPMENT

- **CRITICAL THINKING:** ANALYZE THE IMPACT OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ON PLANT SURVIVAL.
- **REASONING:** JUSTIFY CHOICES IN A BREEDING PROGRAMME BASED ON SELECTED TRAITS.
- **ANALYSIS:** COMPARE AND CONTRAST NATURAL SELECTION AND SELECTIVE BREEDING.

BY UNDERSTANDING THESE CONCEPTS, YOU CAN APPRECIATE THE ROLE OF VARIATION AND SELECTION IN BOTH NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS AND AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION

## NATURAL SELECTION, EVOLUTION, AND SELECTIVE BREEDING

NATURAL SELECTION IS A FUNDAMENTAL PROCESS IN EVOLUTION WHERE ORGANISMS BETTER SUITED TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT ARE MORE LIKELY TO SURVIVE AND REPRODUCE. SELECTIVE BREEDING, ON THE OTHER HAND, INVOLVES HUMAN INTERVENTION TO PRODUCE OFFSPRING WITH SPECIFIC TRAITS.

### BREEDING PROGRAM EXAMPLE

A BREEDING PROGRAM AIMED AT IMPROVING MAIZE YIELD TYPICALLY INVOLVES CROSSING PURE LINES TO CREATE HYBRIDS. THIS PROCESS INCLUDES SELECTING PURE LINE A, B, OR C, THEN HYBRIDIZING THEM TO PRODUCE HYBRID E, F, OR G. EACH HYBRID EXHIBITS DISTINCT CHARACTERISTICS COMPARED TO THE PURE LINES.

### QUESTIONS FOR ANALYSIS

1. DESCRIBE THE PROCEDURE USED TO PRODUCE HYBRID G.
2. IDENTIFY THREE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HYBRID G AND PURE LINE C.

### REASONING SKILLS

TO DEMONSTRATE GENETIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HYBRID G AND PURE LINE C, ONE COULD EXAMINE SPECIFIC TRAITS OR DNA SEQUENCES, INDICATING A GENETIC BASIS FOR THESE VARIATIONS.

### RESEARCH ASSIGNMENT

CONDUCT RESEARCH AND WRITE AN ESSAY DISCUSSING THE BENEFITS AND CONCERNS OF SELECTIVE BREEDING IN ANIMALS. FOCUS ON A STRUCTURED ANALYSIS RATHER THAN PERSONAL OPINIONS.

### KEY TERMS

- **NATURAL SELECTION**: THE PROCESS WHERE ORGANISMS WITH FAVORABLE TRAITS ARE MORE LIKELY TO SURVIVE AND REPRODUCE.
- **SELECTIVE BREEDING**: THE INTENTIONAL MATING OF ORGANISMS TO PRODUCE OFFSPRING WITH DESIRED TRAITS.

## CONCLUSION

UNDERSTANDING VARIATION AND SELECTION IS CRUCIAL IN BOTH NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS AND AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES. IT HIGHLIGHTS THE COMPLEXITIES OF GENETICS AND THE IMPACT OF HUMAN INTERVENTION IN BREEDING PROGRAMS.

# VARIATION AND SELECTION

  - **MITOSIS:** A TYPE OF CELL DIVISION THAT PRODUCES TWO IDENTICAL DAUGHTER CELLS WITH THE SAME CHROMOSOME NUMBER AS THE PARENT CELL.
  
  - **MEIOSIS:** A SPECIALIZED FORM OF CELL DIVISION THAT HALVES THE CHROMOSOME NUMBER, RESULTING IN FOUR GENETICALLY DIVERSE GAMETES.

# BIOLOGY UNIT 6: MICROORGANISMS AND GENETIC MODIFICATION

## INTRODUCTION TO MICROORGANISMS
MICROORGANISMS ARE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF OUR ECOSYSTEMS, SERVING DUAL ROLES AS BOTH DECOMPOSERS AND PATHOGENS. ESSENTIAL DECOMPOSERS RECYCLE NUTRIENTS BY BREAKING DOWN DEAD ORGANIC MATTER, RETURNING VITAL ELEMENTS TO THE SOIL. PATHOGENS, ON THE OTHER HAND, CAN CAUSE DISEASES IN ANIMALS AND PLANTS, AFFECTING HEALTH AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY.

## BENEFICIAL MICROORGANISMS
BEYOND THEIR ECOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS, CERTAIN MICROORGANISMS ARE CULTIVATED FOR HUMAN USE. THESE BENEFICIAL SPECIES ARE CENTRAL TO BIOTECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS, OFFERING OPPORTUNITIES IN MEDICINE, AGRICULTURE, AND INDUSTRY.

## BIOTECHNOLOGY OVERVIEW
BIOTECHNOLOGY IS CATEGORIZED INTO TWO APPROACHES: TRADITIONAL AND MODERN METHODS. TRADITIONAL TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS FERMENTATION, HAVE BEEN PRACTICED FOR CENTURIES. MODERN BIOTECHNOLOGY, HOWEVER, LEVERAGES GENETIC MODIFICATION TO ENHANCE MICROORGANISMS' CAPABILITIES, ENABLING ADVANCEMENTS IN VARIOUS FIELDS.

## GENETIC MODIFICATION
THIS CHAPTER EXPLORES EXAMPLES OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS, INCLUDING PLANTS AND ANIMALS. IT ALSO DISCUSSES THE ENGINEERING OF MICROORGANISMS TO PRODUCE NOVEL PRODUCTS, A PROCESS THAT HARNESSES THEIR UNIQUE PROPERTIES FOR DIVERSE APPLICATIONS.

### KEY TERMS
- **MICROORGANISMS**: TINY, OFTEN SINGLE-CELLED ORGANISMS THAT CAN BE BENEFICIAL OR HARMFUL.
- **GENETIC ENGINEERING**: THE DELIBERATE ALTERATION OF AN ORGANISM'S GENES TO MODIFY ITS CHARACTERISTICS.

BY UNDERSTANDING THE ROLES AND APPLICATIONS OF MICROORGANISMS AND GENETIC MODIFICATION, WE APPRECIATE THEIR SIGNIFICANCE IN BOTH NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS AND HUMAN INNOVATION.
