# USING MICROORGANISMS

In this chapter we look at microorganisms that are grown in order to make products that are of use to humans.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

- Understand the role of yeast in the production of food, including bread
- Investigate the rate of anaerobic respiration by yeast in different conditions
- Understand the role of bacteria (Lactobacillus) in the production of yoghurt
- Understand the use of an industrial fermenter and explain the need to provide suitable conditions for the growth of microorganisms in the fermenter, including aseptic precautions, nutrients, optimum temperature and pH, oxygenation, and agitation

## WHAT ARE MICROORGANISMS?

Microorganisms are living things that you can only see with the help of a microscope. The 'bodies' of most microorganisms are made of a single cell, although sometimes millions of cells are gathered together to form a colony. The colony of cells may then be visible to the human eye.

Microorganisms have critical roles to play in recycling the waste products of organisms, as well as recycling the organisms themselves when they die. Many types of microorganisms are studied because they cause disease in animals and plants. On the other hand, humans have made use of the great reproductive capacity of microorganisms to make useful products, such as food, drink and medicines.

There are several groups that we call microorganisms, including protoctists, bacteria, viruses and some fungi (see Chapter 2).

Figure 20.1 shows a few examples of the many types of microorganisms.

| Type of Microorganism | Size |
|------------------------|------|
| Protozoa and algae | 10 μm |
| Bacteria | 1 μm |
| Viruses | 0.1 μm - 0.01 μm |
| Fungi (moulds) | 100 μm |
| Yeast | 3 μm |

Figure 20.1 Some examples of microorganisms. They are not drawn to the same scale. Notice the range of size, as shown by the scale bar alongside each organism. One micrometre (1 μm) is a millionth of a metre, or a thousandth of a millimetre.

## FERMENTATION AND BIOTECHNOLOGY

Fermentation and fermenters are terms that you will encounter if you are involved in the growth of microorganisms. What do these words mean? Many microorganisms respire anaerobically (see Chapter 1), and originally, fermentation meant any anaerobic respiration process involving microorganisms, such as the fermentation of sugars by yeast. Nowadays, the word is used more generally to define other metabolic processes carried out by microorganisms, many of which are aerobic. Fermentation is normally used to make a useful product.

This overlaps with the definition of biotechnology, which means using any organisms (but mainly microbes) to make products that are useful to humans. Although the word itself is relatively new, humans have been using biotechnology processes for thousands of years without knowing it. Since ancient times, fermentation by yeast has been used to produce bread. Yoghurt is made by the action of bacteria on milk, and other bacteria and moulds are used in cheese manufacture.

Our ancestors used biotechnology to make products like these, but they did not understand how they were made and had no idea of the existence of microorganisms. Nowadays we understand what is happening when fermentation takes place, and can use biotechnology to produce not just foods but also a huge range of products, from medicines like penicillin to chemicals such as enzymes and fuels.

Modern biotechnology also allows us to alter the genes of microorganisms so that they code for new products. This is called genetic engineering. It is a topic that you will read about in Chapter 21.

## TRADITIONAL BIOTECHNOLOGY – MAKING FOOD AND DRINKS

When yeast cells are deprived of oxygen, they respire anaerobically, breaking sugar down into ethanol and carbon dioxide:

glucose → ethanol + carbon dioxide

This process has been used for thousands of years to make bread using a species of yeast called Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

### MAKING ALCOHOLIC DRINKS

Wine is made by using yeast to ferment sugars in grape juice. Commercial wine production takes place in large containers called vats which prevent air reaching the wine and ensure conditions remain anaerobic. Homemade wine is produced in small-scale fermenters fitted with an 'airlock', which allows carbon dioxide to escape but prevents the entry of oxygen (Figure 20.2). The alcohol increases in concentration until it kills the yeast cells, at which point fermentation stops.

Beer is made from barley. Barley contains starch rather than sugars so the starch needs to be broken down first. This happens by allowing the barley seeds to germinate. When they start to germinate they produce the enzyme amylase, which breaks down starch into the sugar maltose. Amylase breaks down starch into the sugar maltose. Later, the maltose from the seeds is fermented by yeast in a large open vat (Figure 20.3).

Figure 20.3 A froth forming on the surface of the beer as yeast ferments the sugar to alcohol and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide in the froth prevents oxygen entering the mixture from the air – keeping conditions anaerobic.

## MAKING BREAD

Yeast is also used to make bread. Wheat flour and water are mixed together and yeast added, forming the bread dough. Enzymes from the original cereal grains break down starch to sugars, which are respired by the yeast. Extra sugar may be added at this stage. In bread-making, the yeast begins by respiring aerobically, producing water and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide makes the dough rise. When the air runs out, conditions become anaerobic, so the yeast begins to respire anaerobically making ethanol and more carbon dioxide.

Later, when the dough is baked in the oven, the gas bubbles expand. This gives the bread a light, cellular texture (Figure 20.4). Baking also kills the yeast cells and evaporates any ethanol from the fermentation.

Figure 20.4 (a) The 'holes' in this bread were produced by bubbles of carbon dioxide released from the respiration of the yeast. (b) Bread that is made without yeast is called unleavened bread. What is the difference in texture and appearance between leavened and unleavened bread?

## ACTIVITY 1

### PRACTICAL: INVESTIGATING THE RATE OF ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION IN YEAST

Safety note: Wear eye protection and avoid skin contact with the indicator.

Some simple apparatus and materials can be used to investigate the rate of anaerobic respiration in yeast.

A small amount of water is gently boiled in a boiling tube to remove any air that is dissolved in the water. The water is allowed to cool, and a small amount of sugar (glucose or sucrose) is dissolved in the water. Finally, a little yeast is added and the mixture is stirred.

 INDUSTRIAL FERMENTERS                    fermenter is any vessel that is used to grow microorganisms used for

                                        Industrial fermenters are large tanks that can hold up to 200 000 dm: of a

Figure 20.8 An industrial fermenter. Fermenters like this are used to make many products, such as the antibiotic penicillin.

[Diagram of an industrial fermenter with the following components and descriptions:]

- motor (at the top)
- steam inlet and outlet (at the top)
- inlet and exhaust outlet (at the top)
- temperature and pH probes
- stirring paddles
- water jacket
- cold water inlet and outlet
- air inlet
- filter
- harvesting outlet
- valves (represented by small circles on pipes)

At the start of the process, nutrients are fed in through pipes which can be opened and closed using valves.

The pH of the contents can be adjusted by adding acid or alkali to keep it constant.

Fermentation produces heat, so to prevent the contents from overheating, the fermenter is surrounded by a water jacket through which cold water circulates, keeping the temperature at the best level for growth.

Stirring paddles mix up the contents. This keeps the microorganisms in suspension in the liquid, so that they get more exposure to the nutrients, and helps to keep the temperature even throughout the vessel. Some fermenters use jets of air to mix the contents instead of paddles.

If the organisms respire aerobically, filtered air is supplied through this inlet. The air is filtered to prevent contamination.

Many microorganisms produce acidic waste products, so fermenters have to be made of materials which will not corrode, such as stainless steel or special alloys.

### KEY POINT

Many microorganisms use an external food source from their growth medium to obtain energy. In doing this, they change substances in the medium. This is the modern meaning of fermentation. It is used by humans to make many important products. The use of microorganisms to make products useful to humans is called biotechnology.

When fermentation is completed, the products are collected through an outlet pipe. Before the fermenter is filled with new nutrients and culture, the inside of the tank and all the pipes must be cleaned and sterilised. This is usually done with very hot steam under high pressure.

If the inside of the fermenter and the new nutrients are not sterile, two problems are likely to develop. Firstly, any bacteria or fungi that manage to get in would compete with the organism in the culture, reducing the yield of product. Secondly, the product would become contaminated with waste products or cells of the 'foreign' organism. The methods used to prevent contamination by unwanted microorganisms such as filtering the air and sterilising the fermenter using steam, are known as 'aseptic precautions'.
