# MICROORGANISMS AND GENETIC MODIFICATION

## USING MICROORGANISMS

MICROORGANISMS PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN BOTH TRADITIONAL AND MODERN BIOTECHNOLOGY. ORIGINALLY USED THROUGH FERMENTATION, THEIR APPLICATIONS HAVE EXPANDED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH ADVANCEMENTS IN SCIENCE.

### FERMENTATION AND BIOTECHNOLOGY

FERMENTATION REFERS TO METABOLIC PROCESSES CARRIED OUT BY MICROORGANISMS, OFTEN AEROBIC, THAT PRODUCE USEFUL PRODUCTS. TRADITIONALLY, IT INVOLVED ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION, SUCH AS YEAST CONVERTING SUGARS INTO ETHANOL. THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN UTILIZED FOR MILLENNIA, NOTABLY IN BREAD-MAKING USING *SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE*. BIOTECHNOLOGY, WHICH OVERLAPS WITH FERMENTATION, INVOLVES MANIPULATING ORGANISMS TO CREATE PRODUCTS LIKE YOGURT AND CHEESE.

### TRADITIONAL BIOTECHNOLOGY

YEAST CELLS, WHEN DEPRIVED OF OXYGEN, UNDERGO ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION, CONVERTING GLUCOSE INTO ETHANOL AND CARBON DIOXIDE. THIS PROCESS IS EXEMPLIFIED BY *SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE* IN BREAD-MAKING. THE EQUATION FOR THIS FERMENTATION IS:

**GLUCOSE → ETHANOL + CARBON DIOXIDE**

### MAKING FOOD AND DRINKS

#### ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES

WINE PRODUCTION INVOLVES FERMENTING GRAPE JUICE WITH YEAST IN VATS, WHERE CARBON DIOXIDE ESCAPES WHILE PREVENTING AIR ENTRY. AS ALCOHOL CONCENTRATION INCREASES, YEAST CELLS ARE KILLED, HALTING FERMENTATION.

BEER PRODUCTION USES BARLEY, WHICH REQUIRES GERMINATION TO CONVERT STARCH INTO MALTOSE VIA THE ENZYME AMYLASE. THIS SUGAR IS THEN FERMENTED BY YEAST IN OPEN VATS.

### MODERN BIOTECHNOLOGY

ADVANCEMENTS IN GENETIC ENGINEERING ALLOW MANIPULATION OF MICROORGANISMS TO PRODUCE A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS, INCLUDING PENICILLIN AND ENZYMES. THESE INNOVATIONS EXPAND BEYOND FOOD PRODUCTION TO MEDICINES AND FUELS, SHOWCASING THE POWER OF MODERN BIOTECHNOLOGY.

# MICROORGANISMS AND GENETIC MODIFICATION

## USING MICROORGANISMS

MICROORGANISMS PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN VARIOUS PROCESSES, INCLUDING FERMENTATION, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL IN THE PRODUCTION OF FOOD AND BEVERAGES. THIS SECTION EXPLORES THE FERMENTATION PROCESS AND ITS APPLICATIONS IN BREAD-MAKING.

### FERMENTATION PROCESS

FERMENTATION INVOLVES THE METABOLIC ACTIVITY OF MICROORGANISMS, PARTICULARLY YEAST, TO CONVERT SUGARS INTO ALCOHOL AND CARBON DIOXIDE. THE PROCESS IS FACILITATED BY SPECIFIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS ANAEROBIC ENVIRONMENTS, WHERE OXYGEN IS LIMITED OR ABSENT.

FIGURE 20.2 ILLUSTRATES A SMALL FERMENTER USED FOR HOMEMADE WINE, FEATURING A U-SHAPED AIRLOCK THAT MAINTAINS ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS BY PREVENTING OXYGEN ENTRY WHILE ALLOWING CARBON DIOXIDE TO ESCAPE. THIS SETUP IS CRUCIAL FOR THE FERMENTATION PROCESS, ENSURING THAT YEAST CAN EFFECTIVELY METABOLIZE SUGARS WITHOUT COMPETITION FROM AEROBIC BACTERIA.

THE FERMENTATION OF SUGAR BY YEAST RESULTS IN THE PRODUCTION OF ETHANOL AND CARBON DIOXIDE, WHICH IS EVIDENT IN FIGURE 20.3 AS A FROTH ON THE BEER'S SURFACE. THIS FROTH ACTS AS A NATURAL BARRIER, MAINTAINING ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR THE CONTINUATION OF ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION.

### MAKING BREAD

YEAST IS A KEY INGREDIENT IN BREAD-MAKING, WHERE IT FACILITATES THE LEAVENING PROCESS THROUGH BOTH AEROBIC AND ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION. THE PROCESS INVOLVES SEVERAL STEPS:

1. **MIXING INGREDIENTS**: WHEAT FLOUR AND WATER ARE COMBINED TO FORM DOUGH, TO WHICH YEAST IS ADDED.
2. **STARCH BREAKDOWN**: ENZYMES FROM CEREAL GRAINS BREAK DOWN STARCH INTO SUGARS, PROVIDING A FOOD SOURCE FOR YEAST.
3. **AEROBIC RESPIRATION**: INITIALLY, YEAST PERFORMS AEROBIC RESPIRATION, PRODUCING CARBON DIOXIDE THAT CAUSES THE DOUGH TO RISE.
4. **ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION**: AS OXYGEN IS DEPLETED, YEAST SWITCHES TO ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION, PRODUCING ETHANOL AND ADDITIONAL CARBON DIOXIDE, WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO THE BREAD'S STRUCTURE.

BAKING THE DOUGH RESULTS IN THE EXPANSION OF GAS BUBBLES, CREATING A LIGHT AND CELLULAR TEXTURE. THE PROCESS ALSO KILLS THE YEAST CELLS AND EVAPORATES ANY ETHANOL PRODUCED DURING FERMENTATION.

### DISCUSSION QUESTION

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LEAVENED AND UNLEAVENED BREAD LIES IN THEIR TEXTURES AND APPEARANCES. LEAVENED BREAD, MADE WITH YEAST, HAS A LIGHT, AIRY STRUCTURE DUE TO GAS BUBBLES FORMED DURING FERMENTATION. UNLEAVENED BREAD, WITHOUT YEAST, RETAINS A DENSER, COMPACT TEXTURE WITHOUT THESE BUBBLES.

### ACTIVITY 1: PRACTICAL INVESTIGATION

TO INVESTIGATE THE RATE OF ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION IN YEAST, FOLLOW THIS PROCEDURE:

1. **PREPARATION**: BOIL A SMALL AMOUNT OF WATER IN A BOILING TUBE TO REMOVE DISSOLVED AIR AND ALLOW IT TO COOL.
2. **DISSOLVING SUGAR**: DISSOLVE SUGAR (GLUCOSE OR SUCROSE) IN THE COOLED WATER.
3. **ADDING YEAST**: INTRODUCE YEAST INTO THE MIXTURE AND STIR GENTLY.

THIS SETUP ALLOWS OBSERVATION OF THE FERMENTATION PROCESS, PROVIDING INSIGHTS INTO ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION RATES THROUGH MEASURABLE OUTCOMES SUCH AS GAS PRODUCTION AND DOUGH EXPANSION.

# MICROORGANISMS AND GENETIC MODIFICATION

## MAKING YOGHURT USING MICROORGANISMS

YOGHURT IS A NUTRITIOUS FOOD PRODUCED BY FERMENTING MILK WITH SPECIFIC BACTERIA KNOWN AS LACTIC ACID BACTERIA. THIS FERMENTATION PROCESS TRANSFORMS LIQUID MILK INTO A SEMI-SOLID TEXTURE, OFTEN ACCOMPANIED BY A TANGY FLAVOR DUE TO THE PRODUCTION OF LACTIC ACID.

### THE YOGHURT-MAKING PROCESS

THE PROCESS INVOLVES SEVERAL KEY STEPS:

1. **PASTEURIZATION**: MILK IS HEATED TO 85-95°C FOR 15-30 MINUTES TO KILL NATURAL BACTERIA, ENSURING A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT FOR FERMENTATION.
2. **HOMOGENIZATION**: FAT GLOBULES ARE DISPERSED EVENLY THROUGHOUT THE MILK, RESULTING IN A SMOOTH TEXTURE.
3. **COOLING**: THE MILK IS COOLED TO 40-45°C, AN OPTIMAL TEMPERATURE FOR STARTER BACTERIA GROWTH.
4. **INOCULATION**: A STARTER CULTURE CONTAINING *LACTOBACILLUS* AND *STREPTOCOCCUS* SPECIES IS ADDED TO THE COOLED MILK, INITIATING FERMENTATION.

THE FERMENTATION PROCESS CONVERTS LACTOSE INTO LACTIC ACID, WHICH THICKENS THE MILK AND IMPARTS ITS CHARACTERISTIC FLAVOR.

### TESTING CARBON DIOXIDE PRODUCTION

AN EXPERIMENT CAN BE CONDUCTED TO STUDY YEAST RESPIRATION:

- **MATERIALS NEEDED**: BOILING TUBE, DELIVERY TUBE, LIMEWATER OR HYDROGEN CARBONATE SOLUTION, YEAST-SUGAR MIXTURE, LIQUID PARAFFIN.
- **PROCEDURE**: THE SETUP INVOLVES A WARM ENVIRONMENT FOR 1-2 HOURS, OBSERVING GAS BUBBLES IN THE INDICATOR SOLUTION. LIMEWATER TURNS CLOUDY, WHILE HYDROGEN CARBONATE CHANGES FROM ORANGE TO YELLOW.

### HYPOTHESES TESTING

EXPERIMENTS CAN EXPLORE VARIOUS FACTORS AFFECTING YEAST RESPIRATION, SUCH AS SUGAR TYPE (GLUCOSE, SUCROSE, MALTOSE), CONCENTRATION, AND TEMPERATURE. THE RATE OF RESPIRATION IS MEASURED BY BUBBLE COUNT OR COLOR CHANGE TIMING.

THIS STRUCTURED APPROACH PROVIDES A CLEAR, FACTUAL OVERVIEW SUITABLE FOR VECTOR STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL.

# MICROORGANISMS AND GENETIC MODIFICATION

## USING MICROORGANISMS

### DID YOU KNOW?
DIFFERENT SPECIES OF **LACTOBACILLUS** AND **STREPTOCOCCUS** BACTERIA ARE USED IN CHEESE PRODUCTION. THESE BACTERIA PRODUCE LACTIC ACID, BREAKING DOWN MILK PROTEINS AND CONTRIBUTING TO THE FORMATION OF CHEESE.

### PASTEURISATION
THE PROCESS OF PASTEURISATION WAS DEVELOPED BY LOUIS PASTEUR TO ELIMINATE BACTERIA CAUSING SPOILAGE. INTRODUCED IN 1864, IT INVOLVES HEATING PRODUCTS LIKE MILK TO TEMPERATURES BETWEEN 85-95 °C FOR 15-30 MINUTES. THIS STEP REDUCES BACTERIAL COUNT AND LOWERS PH, INHIBITING MICROORGANISMS WHILE PRESERVING NUTRIENTS.

### YOGHURT PRODUCTION
YOGHURT PRODUCTION FOLLOWS THESE STEPS:
1. MILK IS HOMOGENISED BY COOLING TO 40-45 °C AND INOCULATING WITH LACTIC ACID BACTERIA.
2. INCUBATION OCCURS AT THIS TEMPERATURE FOR SEVERAL HOURS AS BACTERIA FERMENT LACTOSE INTO LACTIC ACID.
3. THE MIXTURE THICKENS, THEN COOLS TO 5 °C BEFORE ADDING FLAVOURINGS OR FRUIT.

### INDUSTRIAL FERMENTERS
INDUSTRIAL FERMENTERS ARE LARGE TANKS CAPABLE OF HOLDING UP TO 200,000 DM³. THEY ALLOW PRECISE CONTROL OF CONDITIONS LIKE TEMPERATURE, OXYGEN LEVELS, AND PH, FACILITATING EFFICIENT MICROBIAL GROWTH FOR FERMENTATION PROCESSES.

### DIAGRAM OF A FERMENTER
A SIMPLIFIED DIAGRAM ILLUSTRATES THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF A FERMENTER, HIGHLIGHTING ITS ABILITY TO MANAGE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ESSENTIAL FOR MICROBIAL ACTIVITY.

THE APPLICATIONS OF MICROORGANISMS IN FOOD PRODUCTION HIGHLIGHT THEIR CRUCIAL ROLE IN FERMENTATION PROCESSES ACROSS VARIOUS INDUSTRIES.

- **NUTRIENT INLET**: AT THE START, NUTRIENTS ARE INTRODUCED THROUGH PIPES WITH ADJUSTABLE VALVES FOR CONTROL.
- **TEMPERATURE AND PH CONTROL**:
  - **TEMPERATURE PROBES**: MONITOR HEAT GENERATED DURING FERMENTATION.
  - **PH PROBES**: ADJUST PH LEVELS USING ACID OR ALKALI TO MAINTAIN OPTIMAL GROWTH CONDITIONS.
- **WATER JACKET**: SURROUNDS THE FERMENTER WITH CIRCULATING COLD WATER TO PREVENT OVERHEATING, MAINTAINING IDEAL TEMPERATURES FOR MICROORGANISMS.
- **STIRRING MECHANISM**:
  - **STIRRING PADDLES**: ENSURE MICROORGANISMS REMAIN SUSPENDED IN LIQUID, PROVIDING ADEQUATE NUTRIENT EXPOSURE.
  - **AIR INLET**: SUPPLIES FILTERED AIR FOR AEROBIC RESPIRATION IF NEEDED.
- **WASTE MANAGEMENT**: CONSTRUCTED FROM MATERIALS LIKE STAINLESS STEEL OR ALLOYS TO RESIST CORROSION CAUSED BY ACIDIC WASTE PRODUCTS.

### ASEPTIC PRECAUTIONS

MAINTAINING A STERILE ENVIRONMENT IS CRUCIAL FOR SUCCESSFUL FERMENTATION:

- **CLEANING AND STERILIZATION**: AFTER FERMENTATION, PRODUCTS ARE COLLECTED THROUGH AN OUTLET. THE FERMENTER MUST BE CLEANED AND STERILIZED WITH HOT STEAM UNDER HIGH PRESSURE BEFORE REUSE.
- **CONTAMINATION PREVENTION**:
  - **COMPETITION**: UNWANTED BACTERIA OR FUNGI CAN REDUCE YIELD IF NOT CONTROLLED.
  - **CONTAMINATION**: PRODUCTS MAY BECOME TAINTED WITH FOREIGN ORGANISMS' WASTE OR CELLS.
- **ASEPTIC METHODS**: TECHNIQUES LIKE AIR FILTRATION AND FERMENTER STERILIZATION PREVENT CONTAMINATION.

### KEY POINTS

- MANY MICROORGANISMS DERIVE ENERGY FROM EXTERNAL FOOD SOURCES IN THEIR GROWTH MEDIUM.
- FERMENTATION'S MODERN APPLICATION BY HUMANS IS REFERRED TO AS BIOTECHNOLOGY, UTILIZING MICROORGANISMS TO PRODUCE BENEFICIAL PRODUCTS.

# MICROORGANISMS AND GENETIC MODIFICATION

## USING MICROORGANISMS

### MAKING YOGHURT: QUESTIONS EXPLORED

THE PROCESS OF MAKING YOGHURT INVOLVES SEVERAL KEY STEPS THAT RELY ON THE ACTIVITY OF SPECIFIC MICROORGANISMS. UNDERSTANDING THESE PROCESSES IS FUNDAMENTAL TO APPRECIATING THEIR ROLE IN FOOD PRODUCTION.

1. **PASTEURISATION OF MILK**: THIS INITIAL STEP IS CRUCIAL AS IT ELIMINATES HARMFUL BACTERIA AND PATHOGENS, ENSURING THE SAFETY AND QUALITY OF THE FINAL PRODUCT. PASTEURISED MILK CAN THEN BE CULTURED WITH BENEFICIAL BACTERIA WITHOUT RISKING CONTAMINATION FROM SPOILAGE ORGANISMS.

2. **INCUBATION TEMPERATURE**: THE OPTIMAL TEMPERATURE FOR YOGHURT PRODUCTION, AROUND 45°C, SUPPORTS THE GROWTH OF *LACTOBACILLUS BULGARICUS* AND *STREPTOCOCCUS THERMOPHILUS*. THESE BACTERIA ARE INSTRUMENTAL IN FERMENTING THE MILK, LEADING TO THE DESIRED TEXTURE AND FLAVOUR THROUGH THEIR METABOLIC ACTIVITIES.

3. **THICKENING OF MILK**: THE THICKENING EFFECT IS PRIMARILY DUE TO BACTERIAL FERMENTATION. LACTIC ACID PRODUCED BY THESE BACTERIA LOWERS THE PH, CAUSING MILK PROTEINS TO COAGULATE. THIS PROCESS RESULTS IN A THICKER CONSISTENCY WHILE ALSO ENHANCING DIGESTIBILITY FOR THOSE WITH LACTOSE INTOLERANCE.

4. **FERMENTATION CESSATION**: FERMENTATION HALTS WHEN THE PH DROPS SUFFICIENTLY TO INHIBIT BACTERIAL GROWTH. ADDITIONALLY, THE DEPLETION OF LACTOSE AND ACCUMULATION OF LACTIC ACID CONTRIBUTE TO THE TERMINATION OF THE FERMENTATION PROCESS.

5. **NUTRIENT PRESERVATION**: THE FERMENTATION PROCESS NOT ONLY PRESERVES BUT ALSO ENHANCES THE BIOAVAILABILITY OF MILK NUTRIENTS. LACTIC ACID BACTERIA BREAK DOWN LACTOSE, MAKING IT EASIER TO DIGEST, WHILE VITAMINS AND MINERALS ARE EFFECTIVELY PRESERVED DURING THIS NATURAL PROCESS.

### CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS

ENGAGING WITH THESE QUESTIONS FOSTERS CRITICAL THINKING ABOUT MICROORGANISMS' ROLE IN FOOD PRODUCTION. UNDERSTANDING THE SCIENCE BEHIND YOGHURT PRODUCTION ILLUSTRATES THE IMPORTANCE OF MICROBIAL INTERACTIONS IN DAILY LIFE, HIGHLIGHTING THEIR SIGNIFICANCE IN BOTH TRADITIONAL AND MODERN CULINARY PRACTICES.
