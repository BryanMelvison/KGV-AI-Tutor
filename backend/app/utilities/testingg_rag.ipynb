       "  \"All living organisms are composed of units called cells. The simplest organisms are made from single cells (Figure 1.1) but more complex plants and animals are composed of millions of cells. In many-celled (multicellular) organisms, there may be hundreds of different types of cells with different structures. They are specialised so that they can carry out particular functions in the animal or plant. Despite all the differences, there are basic features that are the same in all cells.\\n\\n▲ Figure 1.1 Many simple organisms have 'bodies' made from single cells. Here are four examples.\\n---\\n# 4 ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES | LIFE PROCESSES\\n\\nThere are eight life processes which take place in most living things.\\nOrganisms:\\n\\n- require nutrition – plants make their own food, animals eat other organisms\\n- respire – release energy from their food\\n- excrete – get rid of waste products\\n- respond to stimuli – are sensitive to changes in their surroundings\\n- move – by the action of muscles in animals, and slow growth movements in plants\\n- control their internal conditions – maintain a steady state inside the body\\n- reproduce – produce offspring\\n- grow and develop – increase in size and complexity, using materials from their food.\\n\\n## CELL STRUCTURE\\n\\nThis part of the book describes the cell structure of 'higher' organisms such as animals, plants and fungi. The cells of bacteria are simpler in structure and will be described in Chapter 2.\",\n",
       "  \"Most cells contain certain parts such as the nucleus, cytoplasm and cell membrane. Some cells have structures missing, for instance red blood cells are unusual in that they have no nucleus. The first chapter in a biology textbook will usually present diagrams of 'typical' plant and animal cells. In fact, there is really no such thing as a 'typical' cell. Humans, for example, are composed of hundreds of different kinds of cells – from nerve cells to blood cells, skin cells to liver cells. What we really mean by a 'typical' cell is a general diagram that shows all the features that you will find in most cells (Figure 1.2). However, not all these are present in all cells – for example the cells in the parts of a plant that are not green do not contain chloroplasts.\\n\\n| animal cell | plant cell |\\n|-------------|------------|\\n| nucleus | cell wall |\\n| cell membrane | cell membrane (inside cell wall) |\\n| mitochondria | vacuole |\\n| cytoplasm | cytoplasm |\\n| | mitochondria |\\n| | chloroplasts |\\n| | nucleus |\\n\\n▲ Figure 1.2 The structure of a 'typical' animal and plant cell.\\n\\nThe living material that makes up a cell is called cytoplasm. It has a texture rather like sloppy jelly, in other words somewhere between a solid and a liquid. Unlike a jelly, it is not made of one substance but is a complex material made of many different structures. You can't see many of these structures under an ordinary light microscope. An electron microscope has a much higher magnification and can show the details of these structures, which are called organelles (Figure 1.3).\\n---\\n# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES | LIFE PROCESSES\",\n",
       "  \"The largest organelle in the cell is the **nucleus**. Nearly all cells have a nucleus. The few types that don't are usually dead (e.g. the xylem vessels in a stem, Chapter 11) or don't live for very long (e.g. red blood cells, Chapter 5). The nucleus controls the activities of the cell. It contains **chromosomes** (46 in human cells) which carry the genetic material, or **genes**. Genes control the activities in the cell by determining which proteins the cell can make. The DNA remains in the nucleus, but the instructions for making proteins are carried out of the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where the proteins are assembled on tiny structures called **ribosomes**. A cell contains thousands of ribosomes, but they are too small to be seen through a light microscope.\\n\\nOne very important group of proteins found in cells are **enzymes**. Enzymes control the chemical reactions that take place in the cytoplasm.\\n\\nAll cells are surrounded by a **cell membrane**, sometimes called the cell surface membrane to distinguish it from other membranes inside the cell. This is a thin layer like a 'skin' on the surface of the cell. It forms a boundary between the cytoplasm of the cell and the outside. However, it is not a complete barrier. Some chemicals can pass into the cell and others can pass out. We say that the membrane is **partially permeable**. The membrane can go further than this and actually control the movement of some substances – it is **selectively permeable**.\\n\\nOne organelle that is found in the cytoplasm of all living cells is the **mitochondrion** (plural mitochondria). In cells that need a lot of energy such as muscle or nerve cells, there are many mitochondria. This gives us a clue to their function. They carry out some of the reactions of **respiration** (see page 11) releasing energy that the cell can use. Most of the energy from respiration is released in the mitochondria.\\n\\n## PLANT CELLS\",\n",
       "  \"## PLANT CELLS\\n\\nAll of the structures you have seen so far are found in both animal and plant cells. However, some structures are only ever found in plant cells. There are three in particular – the cell wall, a permanent vacuole and chloroplasts.\\n\\nThe **cell wall** is a layer of non-living material that is found outside the cell membrane of plant cells. It is made mainly of a carbohydrate called **cellulose**, although other chemicals may be added to the wall in some cells. Cellulose is a tough material that helps the cell keep its shape and is one reason why the 'body' of a plant has a fixed shape. Animal cells do not have a cell wall and tend to be more variable in shape. Plant cells absorb water, producing an internal pressure that pushes against adjacent cells, giving the plant support (see Chapter 11). Without a cell wall strong enough to resist these pressures, this method of support would be impossible. The cell wall is porous, so it is not a barrier to water or dissolved substances. We call it freely permeable.\\n\\nMature (fully grown) plant cells often have a large central space surrounded by a membrane, called a **vacuole**. This vacuole is a permanent feature of the cell. It is filled with a watery liquid called cell sap, which is a store of dissolved sugars, mineral ions and other solutes. Animal cells do contain vacuoles, but they are only small, temporary structures.\\n\\nCells of the green parts of plants, especially the leaves, contain another very important organelle, the **chloroplast**. Chloroplasts absorb light energy to make food in the process of photosynthesis (see Chapter 10). They contain a green pigment called **chlorophyll**. Cells from the parts of a plant that are not green, such as the flowers, roots and woody stems, have no chloroplasts.\",\n",
       "  \"| KEY POINT |\\n|-----------|\\n| Nearly all cells contain cytoplasm, a nucleus, a cell membrane and mitochondria. As well as these structures, plant cells have a cell wall and a permanent vacuole, and plant cells that photosynthesise contain chloroplasts. |\\n---\\nMARKDOWN_EXTRACTION_FAILED\\n---\\n# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES | LIFE PROCESSES\\n\\nThe molecule that an enzyme acts on is called its substrate. Each enzyme has a small area on its surface called the active site. The substrate attaches to the active site of the enzyme. The reaction then takes place and products are formed. When the substrate joins up with the active site it lowers the energy needed for the reaction to start, allowing the products to be formed more easily.\\n\\nEnzymes also catalyse reactions where large molecules are built up from smaller ones. In this case, several substrate molecules attach to the active site, the reaction takes place and the larger product molecule is formed. The product then leaves the active site.\\n\\nThe substrate fits into the active site of the enzyme like a key fitting into a lock. Just as a key will only fit one lock, a substrate will only fit into the active site of a particular enzyme. This is known as the lock and key model of enzyme action. It is the reason why enzymes are specific, i.e. an enzyme will only catalyse one reaction.\\n\\n| 1 | 2 |\\n|---|---|\\n|  |  |\\n| 4 | 3 |\\n|  |  |\\n\\n▲ Figure 1.5 Enzymes catalyse reactions at their active site. This acts like a 'lock' to the substrate 'key'. The substrate fits into the active site, and products are formed. This happens more easily than without the enzyme – so enzymes act as catalysts.\\n\\nAfter an enzyme molecule has catalysed a reaction, the product is released from the active site, and the enzyme is free to act on more substrate molecules.\\n\\n## FACTORS AFFECTING ENZYMES\",\n",
       "  \"## FACTORS AFFECTING ENZYMES\\n\\nA number of factors affect the activity of enzymes. The rate of reaction may be increased by raising the concentration of the enzyme or the substrate. Two other factors that affect enzymes are temperature and pH.\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\n'Optimum' temperature means the 'best' temperature, in other words the temperature at which the reaction takes place most rapidly.\\n\\n### TEMPERATURE\\n\\nThe effect of temperature on the action of an enzyme is easiest to see as a graph, where we plot the rate of the reaction against temperature (Figure 1.6).\\n\\nEnzymes in the human body have evolved to work best at body temperature (37 °C). The graph in Figure 1.6 shows a peak on the curve at this temperature, which is called the optimum temperature for the enzyme.\\n\\nAs the enzyme is heated up to the optimum temperature, the rise in temperature increases the rate of reaction. This is because higher temperatures give the molecules of the enzyme and the substrate more kinetic energy, so they collide more often. More collisions means that the reaction will take place more frequently.\\n\\n### DID YOU KNOW?\\n\\nKinetic energy is the energy an object has because of its movement. The molecules of enzyme and substrate are moving faster, so they have more kinetic energy.\\n---\\n# 8 ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES | LIFE PROCESSES\\n\\n## Effect of Temperature on Enzyme Action\\n\\nEffect of temperature on the action of an enzyme\",\n",
       "  '## Effect of Temperature on Enzyme Action\\n\\nEffect of temperature on the action of an enzyme\\n\\n| Temperature (°C) | Rate of enzyme-catalysed reaction (arbitrary unit) |\\n|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\\n| 0                | 0                                                 |\\n| 10               | Low                                               |\\n| 20               | Medium                                            |\\n| 30               | High                                              |\\n| 40               | Peak (Optimum temperature)                        |\\n| 50               | High                                              |\\n| 60               | Low                                               |\\n| 70               | Very low                                          |\\n\\nFigure 1.6 Effect of temperature on the action of an enzyme.\\n\\nHowever, above the optimum, temperature starts to have another effect. Enzymes are made of protein, and proteins are broken down by heat. From 40 °C upwards, the heat destroys the enzyme. We say that it is denatured. You can see the effect of denaturing when you boil an egg. The egg white is made of protein, and turns from a clear runny liquid into a white solid as the heat denatures the protein. Denaturing changes the shape of the active site so that the substrate will no longer fit into it. Denaturing is permanent – the enzyme molecules will no longer catalyse the reaction.\\n\\nNot all enzymes have an optimum temperature near 37 °C, only those of animals such as mammals and birds, which all have body temperatures close to this value. Enzymes have evolved to work best at the normal body temperature of the organism. Bacteria that always live at an average temperature of 10 °C will probably have enzymes with an optimum temperature near 10 °C.\\n\\n## pH',\n",
       "  '## pH\\n\\nThe pH around the enzyme is also important. The pH inside cells is neutral (pH 7) and most enzymes have evolved to work best at this pH. At extremes of pH either side of neutral, the enzyme activity decreases, as shown in Figure 1.7. The pH at which the enzyme works best is called its optimum pH. Either side of the optimum, the pH affects the structure of the enzyme molecule and changes the shape of its active site, so that the substrate will not fit into it so well.\\n\\nMost enzymes work best at a neutral pH\\n\\n| pH | Rate of enzyme-catalysed reaction (arbitrary units) |\\n|----|---------------------------------------------------|\\n| 5  | Low                                               |\\n| 6  | Medium                                            |\\n| 7  | Peak (Optimum pH)                                 |\\n| 8  | Medium                                            |\\n| 9  | Low                                               |\\n\\nFigure 1.7 Most enzymes work best at a neutral pH.\\n\\n### KEY POINT',\n",

The stomach produces hydrochloric acid, which makes its contents very acidic (see Chapter 4).

It gets this energy by breaking down food molecules to release the stored chemical energy that they contain. This process is called respiration. Many people think that respiration means the same as 'breathing', but although there are links between the two processes, the biological meaning of respiration is very different.\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\nRespiration is called an oxidation reaction, because oxygen is used to break down food molecules.\\n\\nRespiration happens in all the cells of our body. Oxygen is used to oxidise food, and carbon dioxide (and water) are released as waste products. The main food oxidised is a sugar called glucose. Glucose contains stored chemical energy that can be converted into other forms of energy that the cell can use. It is rather like burning a fuel to get the energy out of it, except that burning releases most of the energy as heat. Respiration releases some heat energy, but most is used to make a substance called ATP (see below). The energy stored in the ATP molecules can then be used for a variety of purposes, such as:\\n\\n- contraction of muscle cells, producing movement\\n- active transport of molecules and ions (see page 17)\\n- building large molecules, such as proteins\\n- cell division.\\n\\nThe energy released as heat is also used to maintain a constant body temperature in mammals and birds (see Chapter 8).\",\n",
       "  \"The overall reaction for respiration is:\\n\\n| glucose | + | oxygen | → | carbon dioxide | + | water | (+ energy) |\\n|---------|---|--------|---|----------------|---|-------|------------|\\n| C₆H₁₂O₆ | + | 6O₂    | → | 6CO₂           | + | 6H₂O  | (+ energy) |\\n\\n### DID YOU KNOW?\\n\\nCarbon from the respired glucose passes out into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. The carbon can be traced through this pathway using a radioactive form of carbon called carbon-14.\\n\\nThis is called aerobic respiration, because it uses oxygen. Aerobic respiration happens in the cells of humans and those of animals, plants and many other organisms. It is important to realise that the equation above is only a summary of the process. It actually takes place gradually, as a sequence of small steps, which release the energy of the glucose in small amounts. Each step in the process is catalysed by a different enzyme. The later steps in the process are the aerobic ones, and these release the most energy. They happen in the mitochondria of the cell.\\n\\n## ATP – THE ENERGEY 'CURRENCY' OF THE CELL\\n\\nRespiration releases energy while other cell processes use it up. Cells have a way of passing the energy from respiration to the other processes that need it. They do this using a chemical called adenosine triphosphate or ATP. ATP is present in all living cells.\\n---\\n## ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES | LIFE PROCESSES\\n\\nATP is composed of an organic molecule called adenosine attached to three phosphate groups. In a cell, ATP can be broken down losing one phosphate group and forming adenosine diphosphate or ADP (Figure 1.9 (a)).\\n\\n(a) When energy is needed ATP is broken down into ADP and phosphate (P):\\n\\n| adenosine | P | P | P | + H₂O | → | adenosine | P | P | + | P |\\n|-----------|---|---|---|--------|---|-----------|---|---|---|---|\\n\\n(b) During respiration ATP is made from ADP and phosphate:\",\n",

It transfers energy between the process that releases it (respiration) and the processes in a cell that use it up.\\n\\n## ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION\\n\\nThere are some situations where cells can respire without using oxygen. This is called anaerobic respiration. In anaerobic respiration, glucose is not completely broken down, so less energy is released. The advantage of anaerobic respiration is that it can occur in situations where oxygen is in short supply. Two important examples of this are in yeast cells and muscle cells.\\n\\nYeasts are single-celled fungi. They are used in commercial processes such as making wine and beer, and baking bread. When yeast cells are prevented from getting enough oxygen, they stop respiring aerobically and start to respire anaerobically instead. The glucose is partly broken down into ethanol (alcohol) and carbon dioxide:\\n\\nglucose → ethanol + carbon dioxide (+ some energy)\\n\\nThis process is described in more detail in Chapter 21. The ethanol from this type of respiration is the alcohol formed in wine- and beer-making. The carbon dioxide is the gas that makes bread dough rise.\\n\\nThink about the properties of ethanol – it makes a good fuel and will burn to produce a lot of heat, so it still has a lot of chemical energy 'stored' in it.\",\n",
       "  \"Muscle cells can also respire anaerobically when they are short of oxygen. If muscles are overworked, the blood cannot reach them fast enough to deliver enough oxygen for aerobic respiration. This happens when a person does a 'burst' of activity, such as a sprint, or quickly lifting a heavy weight. This time the glucose is broken down into a substance called lactate:\\n\\nglucose → lactate (+ some energy)\\n\\nAnaerobic respiration provides enough energy to keep the overworked muscles going for a short period. During the exercise, the level of lactate rises in the muscle cells and bloodstream.\\n---\\n# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES | LIFE PROCESSES\\n\\n> Uncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

As you have seen, the cell surface membrane can control which chemicals can pass in and out – it is described as selectively permeable.\\n\\nThere are three main ways that molecules and ions can move through the membrane. They are diffusion, active transport and osmosis.\\n\\n### DIFFUSION',\n",
       "  '### DIFFUSION\\n\\nMany substances can pass through the membrane by diffusion. Diffusion happens when a substance is more concentrated in one place than another. For example, if the cell is making carbon dioxide by respiration, the concentration of carbon dioxide inside the cell will be higher than outside. This difference in concentration is called a concentration gradient. The molecules of carbon dioxide are constantly moving about because of their kinetic energy. The cell membrane is permeable to carbon dioxide, so the molecules can move in either direction through it. Since there is a higher concentration of carbon dioxide molecules inside the cell than outside, over time, more molecules will move from inside to outside than move in the other direction. We say that there is a net movement of the molecules out of the cell (Figure 1.12).\\n\\n![Figure 1.12 Carbon dioxide is produced by respiration, so its concentration builds up inside the cell. Although the carbon dioxide molecules diffuse in both directions across the cell membrane, the overall (net) movement is out of the cell, down the concentration gradient.]\\n\\n| carbon dioxide molecules |\\n|--------------------------|\\n| • •                      |\\n| • • •                    |\\n| • • • •                  |\\n\\n#### KEY POINT\\nDiffusion is the net movement of particles (molecules or ions) from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration, i.e. down a concentration gradient.\\n\\nThe opposite happens with oxygen. Respiration uses up oxygen, so there is a concentration gradient of oxygen from outside to inside the cell. There is therefore a net movement of oxygen into the cell by diffusion.\\n\\nThe rate of diffusion is affected by various factors.',\n",

       "  \"## ACTIVE TRANSPORT\\n\\nDiffusion happens because of the kinetic energy of the particles. It does not need an 'extra' source of energy from respiration. However, sometimes a cell needs to take in a substance when there is very little of that substance outside the cell, in other words against a concentration gradient. It can do this by another process, called active transport.\\n\\nDuring active transport a cell uses energy from respiration to take up substances, rather like a pump uses energy to move a liquid from one place to another. In fact, biologists speak of the cell 'pumping' ions or molecules in or out. The pumps are large protein molecules located in the cell membrane, and they are driven by the breakdown of ATP. An example of a place where this happens is in the human small intestine, where some glucose in the gut is absorbed into the cells lining the intestine by active transport. The roots of plants also take up certain mineral ions in this way. Cells use active transport to control the uptake of many substances.\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\nActive transport is the movement of substances against a concentration gradient, using energy from respiration.\\n\\n## OSMOSIS\\n\\nWater moves across cell membranes by a special sort of diffusion, called osmosis. Osmosis happens when the total concentrations of all dissolved substances inside and outside the cell are different. Water will move across the membrane from the more dilute solution to the more concentrated one. Notice that this is still obeying the rules of diffusion – the water moves from where there is a higher concentration of water molecules to a lower concentration of water molecules. Osmosis can only happen if the membrane is permeable to water but not to some other solutes. We say that it is partially permeable.\\n\\nOsmosis is important for moving water from cell to cell, for example in plant roots. You will find out more about osmosis in Chapter 11.\",\n",
       "  \"### KEY POINT\\nOsmosis in cells is the net movement of water from a dilute solution to a more concentrated solution across the partially permeable cell membrane.\\n\\n## SPECIALISED EXCHANGE SURFACES\\n\\nAll cells exchange substances with their surroundings, but some parts of animals or plants are specially adapted for the exchange of materials because they have a very large surface area in proportion to their volume. In animals, two examples are the alveoli (air sacs) of the lungs (Chapter 3) and the villi of the small intestine (Chapter 4). Diffusion is a slow process, and organs that rely on diffusion need a large surface over which it can take place. The alveoli allow the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide to take place between the air and the blood during breathing. The villi of the small intestine provide a large surface area for the absorption of digested food. In plants, exchange surfaces are also adapted by having a large surface area, such as the spongy mesophyll of the leaf (Chapter 10) and the root hairs.\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\n'Adapted' or 'an adaptation' means that the structure of a cell or an organism is suited to its function. It is a word that is very commonly used in biology, and will appear again in many of the chapters of this book. We also use it when we say that organisms are adapted to their environment.\\n\\n## CELLS, TISSUES AND ORGANS\\n\\nCells with a similar function are grouped together as tissues. For example, the muscle of your arm contains millions of similar muscle cells, all specialised for one function – contraction to move the arm bones. This is muscle tissue. However, a muscle also contains other tissues, such as blood, nervous tissue and epithelium (lining tissue). A collection of several tissues carrying out a particular function is called an organ. The main organs of the human body are shown in Figure 1.14. Plants also have tissues and organs. Leaves, roots, stems and flowers are all plant organs.\",\n",

You might like to look on the Internet for some electron micrographs and carry out some further research into cells.\\n\\nElectron micrographs allow us to see cells at a much greater magnification than by using a light microscope. They also reveal more detail. The image produced by a light microscope can only distinguish features about the size of a mitochondrion. The electron microscope has a much greater resolution. Resolution is the ability to distinguish two points in an image as being separate. The maximum resolution of a light microscope is about 200 nanometres (nm), while with an electron microscope we can distinguish structures less than 1 nm in size. That is why ribosomes are only visible using an electron microscope – they are about 25 nm in diameter. A nanometre (nm) is 10⁻⁹ m, or one millionth of a millimetre.\\n\\nElectron microscopy reveals that much of the cytoplasm is made up of membranes. As well as the cell surface membrane, there are membranes around organelles such as the nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts. In addition, there is an extensive system of membranes running throughout the cytoplasm, called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Some ER is covered in ribosomes, and is called rough ER (Figure 1.15).\\n\\nFigure 1.15 Rough endoplasmic reticulum is a system of membranes extending throughout the cytoplasm of a cell.

       "  \"## 2 THE VARIETY OF LIVING ORGANISMS\\n\\nThere is an enormous variety of living organisms. Biologists put them into groups according to their structure and function. The members of each group have certain features in common.\\n\\n### LEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n- Understand the difference between eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms\\n- Describe the features common to plants and recognise examples of flowering plants such as maize, peas and beans\\n- Describe the features common to animals and recognise examples such as mammals and insects\\n- Describe the features common to fungi and recognise examples such as Mucor and yeast\\n- Describe the features common to protoctists and recognise examples such as Amoeba, Chlorella and Plasmodium\\n- Describe the features common to bacteria and recognise examples such as Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Pneumococcus\\n- Describe the features common to viruses and recognise examples such as the influenza virus, the HIV virus and the tobacco mosaic virus\\n- Understand the term 'pathogen' and know that pathogens may include fungi, bacteria, protoctists or viruses.\\n\\nThere are more than ten million species of organisms alive on Earth today, and many more that once lived on Earth but are now extinct. In order to make sense of this enormous variety biologists classify organisms, putting them into groups. Members of each group are related – they are descended from a common ancestor by the process of evolution (see Chapter 19). This common ancestry is reflected in the similarities of structure and function of the members of a group.\\n\\nThe five major groups of living organisms are plants, animals, fungi, protoctists and bacteria.\\n\\n### PLANTS\",\n",
       "  \"### PLANTS\\n\\nYou will be familiar with flowering plants, such as those shown in Figure 2.1. This group, or kingdom, also contains simpler plants, such as mosses and ferns. All plants are multicellular, which means that their 'bodies' are made up of many cells. Their main distinguishing feature is that their cells contain chloroplasts and they carry out photosynthesis – the process that uses light energy to convert simple inorganic molecules such as water and carbon dioxide into complex organic compounds (see Chapter 10). One of these organic compounds is the carbohydrate cellulose, and all plants have cell walls made of this material.\\n\\nPlants can make many other organic compounds as a result of photosynthesis. One of the first to be made is the storage carbohydrate starch, which is often found inside plant cells. Another is the sugar sucrose, which is transported around the plant and is sometimes stored in fruits and other plant organs. The structure and function of flowering plants is dealt with in Unit 3 of this book.\\n\\nFigure 2.1 (a) A pea plant. Its leaves and stem cells contain chloroplasts, giving them their green colour. The white flowers are pollinated by insects. (b) Maize plants are pollinated by wind. These are the male flowers, which make the pollen. (c) The female maize flowers produce seeds after pollination.\\n---\\n## ANIMALS\\n\\nYou will be even more familiar with this kingdom, since it contains the species Homo sapiens, i.e. humans! The variety of the animal kingdom is also enormous, including organisms such as sponges, molluscs, worms, starfish, insects and crustaceans, through to larger animals such as fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals (Figure 2.2). The last five groups are all vertebrates, which means that they have a vertebral column, or backbone. All other animals lack this feature, and are called invertebrates.\",\n",
       "  \"Figure 2.2 (a) A housefly. (b) A mosquito, feeding on human blood. Houseflies and mosquitoes are both insects, which make up the largest sub-group of all the animals. About 60% of all animal species are insects. (c) This high jumper's movement is coordinated by a complex nervous system.\\n\\nAnimals are also multicellular organisms. Their cells never contain chloroplasts, so they are unable to carry out photosynthesis. Instead, they gain their nutrition by feeding on other animals or plants. Animal cells also lack cell walls, which allows their cells to change shape, an important feature for organisms that need to move from place to place. Movement in animals is achieved in various ways, but often involves coordination by a nervous system (see Chapter 6). Another feature common to most animals is that they store carbohydrate in their cells as a compound called glycogen (see Chapter 4). The structure and function of animals is dealt with in Unit 2 of this book.\\n\\n## FUNGI\\n\\nFungi include mushrooms and toadstools, as well as moulds. These groups of fungi are multicellular. Another group of fungi is the yeasts, which are unicellular (made of single cells). Different species of yeasts live everywhere – on the surface of fruits, in soil, water, and even on dust in the air. The yeast powder used for baking contains millions of yeast cells (Figure 2.3). The cells of fungi never contain chloroplasts, so they cannot photosynthesise. Their cells have cell walls, but they are not composed of cellulose (Figure 2.4).\\n\\n### EXTENSION WORK\\n\\nBecause fungi have cell walls, they were once thought to be plants that had lost their chlorophyll. We now know that their cell wall is not made of cellulose as in plants, but of a different chemical called chitin (the same material that makes up the outside skeleton of insects). There are many ways that fungi are very different from plants (the most obvious is that fungi do not photosynthesise) and they are not closely related to plants at all.\",\n",

       "  \"## PROTOCTISTS\\n\\nProtoctists are sometimes called the 'dustbin kingdom', because they are a mixed group of organisms that don't fit into the plants, animals or fungi. Most protoctists are microscopic single-celled organisms (Figure 2.8). Some look like animal cells, such as Amoeba, which lives in pond water. These are known as protozoa. Other protoctists have chloroplasts and carry out photosynthesis, so are more like plants. These are called algae. Most algae are unicellular, but some species such as seaweeds are multicellular and can grow to a great size. Some protoctists are the agents of disease, such as Plasmodium, the organism that causes malaria.\\n\\nFigure 2.8 (a) Amoeba, a protozoan that lives in ponds (b) Chlorella, a unicellular freshwater alga (c) Blood cells containing the protoctist parasite Plasmodium, the organism responsible for causing malaria\\n\\n## EUKARYOTIC AND PROKARYOTIC ORGANISMS\\n\\nAll the organisms described so far are composed of eukaryotic cells and are known as eukaryotic organisms. 'Eukaryotic' means 'having a nucleus' – their cells contain a nucleus surrounded by a membrane, along with other membrane bound organelles, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts.\\n\\nThere are also organisms made of simpler cells, which have no nucleus, mitochondria or chloroplasts. These are called prokaryotic cells. 'Prokaryotic' means 'before nucleus'. The main forms of prokaryotic organisms are the bacteria.\\n\\n## BACTERIA\\n\\nBacteria are small single-celled organisms. Their cells are much smaller than those of eukaryotic organisms and have a much simpler structure. To give you some idea of their size, a typical animal cell might be 10 to 50μm in diameter (1 μm, or one micrometre, is a millionth of a metre). Compared with this, a typical bacterium is only 1 to 5μm in length (Figure 2.9) and its volume is thousands of times smaller than that of the animal cell.\",\n",
       "  'There are three basic shapes of bacteria: spheres, rods and spirals, but they all have a similar internal structure (Figure 2.10).\\n\\nAll bacteria are surrounded by a cell wall, which protects the bacterium and keeps the shape of the cell. Bacterial cell walls are not made of cellulose but a complex compound of sugars and proteins called peptidoglycan. Some species have another layer outside this wall, called a capsule or slime layer. Both give the bacterium extra protection. Underneath the cell wall is the cell membrane, as in other cells. The middle of the cell is made of cytoplasm. Since it is a prokaryotic cell, the bacterium has no nucleus. Instead, its genetic material (DNA) is in a single chromosome, loose in the cytoplasm, forming a circular loop.\\n\\nFigure 2.9 A bacterium is much smaller than an animal cell.

       "  \"Scale: 1 μm\\n\\nSome bacteria can swim, propelled through water by corkscrew-like movements of structures called flagella (a single one is called a flagellum). However, many bacteria do not have flagella and cannot move by themselves. Other structures present in the cytoplasm include the plasmids. These are small circular rings of DNA, carrying some of the bacterium's genes. Not all bacteria contain plasmids, although about three-quarters of all known species do. Plasmids have very important uses in genetic engineering (see Chapter 21).\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\n\\nPathogens are organisms that cause disease. Many common animal and plant diseases are caused by bacteria or viruses. Most protoctists are free-living, but a few species are pathogens, such as Plasmodium (Figure 2.8). Even some species of fungi can cause disease, e.g. the skin infection called 'athlete's foot' is caused by a mould.\\n\\nSome bacteria contain a form of chlorophyll in their cytoplasm, and can carry out photosynthesis. However, most bacteria feed off other living or dead organisms. Along with the fungi, many bacteria are important decomposers (see Chapter 14), recycling dead organisms and waste products in the soil and elsewhere. Some bacteria are used by humans to make food, such as Lactobacillus bulgaricus, a rod-shaped species used in the production of yoghurt from milk (Figure 2.11). Other species are pathogens, which means that they cause disease (Figure 2.12).\\n\\nDespite the relatively simple structure of the bacterial cell, it is still a living cell that carries out the normal processes of life, such as respiration, feeding, excretion, growth and reproduction. As you have seen, some bacteria can move, and they can also respond to a range of stimuli. For example, they may move towards a source of food, or away from a poisonous chemical. You should think about these features when you compare bacteria with the next group, the much simpler viruses.\",\n",
       "  \"Figure 2.11 The bacterium Lactobacillus bulgaricus, used in the production of yoghurt.\\n\\n## VIRUSES\\n\\nAll viruses are parasites, and can only reproduce inside living cells. The cell in which the virus lives is called the host. There are many different types of viruses. Some live in the cells of animals or plants, and there are even viruses which infect bacteria. Viruses are much smaller than bacterial cells: most are between 0.01 and 0.1 μm in diameter (Figure 2.9).\\n\\nViruses are not made of cells. A virus particle is very simple. It has no nucleus or cytoplasm, and is composed of a core of genetic material surrounded by a protein coat (Figure 2.13). The genetic material can be either DNA, or a similar chemical called ribonucleic acid (RNA). In either case, the genetic material makes up just a few genes – all that is needed for the virus to reproduce inside its host cell.\\n\\nFigure 2.12 Rounded cells of the bacterium Pneumococcus, one cause of pneumonia.\\n---\\nORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES    THE VARIETY OF LIVING ORGANISMS    27\\n\\nFigure 2.13 The structure of a typical virus, such as the type causing influenza (flu).\\n\\nSometimes a membrane called an envelope may surround a virus particle, but the virus does not make this. Instead it is 'stolen' from the surface membrane of the host cell.\\n\\nViruses do not feed, respire, excrete, move, grow or respond to their surroundings. They do not carry out any of the normal 'characteristics' of living things except reproduction, and they can only do this parasitically. This is why biologists do not consider viruses to be living organisms. You can think of them as being on the border between an organism and a non-living chemical.\",\n",
       "  \"A virus reproduces by entering the host cell and taking over the host's genetic machinery to make more virus particles. After many virus particles have been made, the host cell dies and the particles are released to infect more cells. Many human diseases are caused in this way, such as influenza ('flu'). Other examples include colds, measles, mumps, polio and rubella ('German measles'). Of course, the reproduction process does not continue forever. Usually, the body's immune system destroys the virus and the person recovers. Sometimes, however, a virus cannot be destroyed by the immune system quickly enough, and it may cause permanent damage or death. With other infections, the virus may attack cells of the immune system itself. This is the case with HIV (the Human Immunodeficiency Virus), which causes the illness called AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome).\\n\\nViruses don't just parasitise animal cells. Some infect plant cells, such as the tobacco mosaic virus (Figure 2.14), which interferes with the ability of the tobacco plant to make chloroplasts, causing mottled patches to develop on the leaves (Figure 2.15).\\n\\n## EXTENSION WORK\\n\\nAIDS is not actually a disease but a 'syndrome'. A syndrome is a set of symptoms caused by a medical condition. In the case of HIV, the virus severely damages the person's immune system, so they are more likely to get other diseases, such as tuberculosis. They may also develop some unusual types of cancer. This collection of different symptoms is referred to as AIDS.\\n\\nFigure 2.15 Discolouration of the leaves of a tobacco plant, caused by infection with tobacco mosaic virus.\\n\\nFigure 2.14 (a) Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), seen through an electron microscope.

       "  \"# 3 BREATHING AND GAS EXCHANGE\\n\\nWhen we breathe, air is moved in and out of the lungs so that gas exchange can take place between the air and the blood. This chapter looks at these processes, and also deals with some ways that smoking can damage the lungs and stop these vital organs from working properly.\\n\\n## LEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n- Describe the structure of the thorax, including the ribs, intercostal muscles, diaphragm, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli and pleural membranes\\n- Understand the role of the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm in ventilation\\n- Explain how alveoli are adapted for gas exchange by diffusion between air in the lungs and blood in capillaries\\n- Investigate breathing in humans, including the release of carbon dioxide and the effect of exercise\\n- Understand the biological consequences of smoking in relation to the lungs and circulatory system, including coronary heart disease.\\n\\nCells get their energy by oxidising foods such as glucose, during the process called respiration. If cells are to respire aerobically, they need a continuous supply of oxygen from the blood. In addition, carbon dioxide from respiration needs to be removed from the body. In humans, these gases are exchanged between the blood and the air in the lungs.\\n\\n## RESPIRATION AND BREATHING\\n\\nYou need to understand the difference between respiration and breathing. Respiration is the oxidation reaction that releases energy from foods such as glucose (Chapter 1). Breathing is the mechanism that moves air into and out of the lungs, allowing gas exchange to take place. The lungs and associated structures are often called the 'respiratory system' but this can be confusing. It is better to call them the gas exchange system and this is the term we use in this book.\\n\\n## THE STRUCTURE OF THE GAS EXCHANGE SYSTEM\",\n",
       "  \"## THE STRUCTURE OF THE GAS EXCHANGE SYSTEM\\n\\nThe lungs are enclosed in the chest or thorax by the ribcage and a muscular sheet of tissue called the diaphragm (Figure 3.1). As you will see, the actions of these two structures bring about the movements of air into and out of the lungs. Joining each rib to the next are two sets of muscles called intercostal muscles ('costals' are rib bones). The diaphragm separates the contents of the thorax from the abdomen. It is not flat, but a shallow dome shape, with a fibrous middle part forming the 'roof' of the dome, and muscular edges forming the walls.\\n---\\n# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY                             BREATHING AND GAS EXCHANGE\\n\\n## Figure 3.2 This cast of the human lungs was made by injecting a pair of lungs with a liquid plastic. The plastic was allowed to set, then the lung tissue was dissolved away with acid.\\n\\n[Image of colorful lung cast]\\n\\n## Figure 3.1 The human gas exchange system\\n\\n[Diagram of human respiratory system with labels]\\n\\n| Label | Part |\\n|-------|------|\\n| start of gullet (oesophagus) | |\\n| trachea | |\\n| larynx | |\\n| ring of cartilage | |\\n| left bronchus | |\\n| bronchioles | |\\n| alveoli | |\\n| heart | |\\n| pleural membranes | |\\n| internal intercostal muscle | |\\n| external intercostal muscle | |\\n| pleural fluid (in pleural cavity) | |\\n| ribs | |\\n| muscular part of the diaphragm | |\\n| fibrous part of the diaphragm | |\\n\\nThe air passages of the lungs form a highly branching network (Figure 3.2). This is why it is sometimes called the bronchial tree.\\n\\nWhen we breathe in, air enters our nose or mouth and passes down the windpipe or trachea. The trachea splits into two tubes called the bronchi (singular bronchus), one leading to each lung. Each bronchus divides into smaller and smaller tubes called bronchioles, eventually ending at microscopic air sacs, called alveoli (singular alveolus). It is here that gas exchange with the blood takes place.\",\n",
       "  \"The walls of trachea and bronchi contain rings of gristle or cartilage. These support the airways and keep them open when we breathe in. They are rather like the rings in a vacuum cleaner hose – without them the hose would squash flat when the cleaner sucks air in.\\n\\nThe inside of the thorax is separated from the lungs by two thin, moist membranes called the pleural membranes. They make up a continuous envelope around the lungs, forming an airtight seal. Between the two membranes is a space called the pleural cavity, filled with a thin layer of liquid called pleural fluid. This acts as lubrication, so that the surfaces of the lungs don't stick to the inside of the chest wall when we breathe.\\n\\n## Figure 3.3 C-shaped cartilage rings in the trachea.\\n\\n[Diagram of esophagus and trachea]\\n\\n| Label | Part |\\n|-------|------|\\n| oesophagus | |\\n| trachea | |\\n| bulge where food is passing down oesophagus | |\\n| C-shaped rings of cartilage in wall of trachea | |\\n\\n### EXTENSION WORK\\n\\nIn the bronchi, the cartilage forms complete, circular rings. In the trachea, the rings are incomplete, and shaped like a letter 'C'. The open part of the ring is at the back of the trachea, next to where the oesophagus (gullet) lies as it passes through the thorax. When food passes along the oesophagus by peristalsis (see Chapter 4) the gaps in the rings allow the lumps of food to pass through more easily, without the peristaltic wave 'catching' on the rings (Figure 3.3).\\n\\n### KEEPING THE AIRWAYS CLEAN\",\n",
       "  \"### KEEPING THE AIRWAYS CLEAN\\n\\nThe trachea and larger airways are lined with a layer of cells that have an important role in keeping the airways clean. Some cells in this lining secrete a sticky liquid called mucus, which traps particles of dirt or bacteria that are breathed in. Other cells are covered with tiny hair-like structures called cilia (Figure 3.4). The cilia beat backward and forward, sweeping the mucus and trapped particles out towards the mouth. In this way, dirt and bacteria are\\n---\\n                ribs\\nbreastbone (sternum)\\n\\n\\nfront of chest\\n\\n                                       external intercostals\\n\\n                                       internal intercostals\\n\\n---\\n# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: BREATHING AND GAS EXCHANGE\\n\\n## Figure 3.6 Changes in the position of the ribs and diaphragm during breathing\\n\\n### (a) Inhalation\\n- Air enters lungs through trachea\\n- Cavity containing pleural fluid expands\\n- Ribs move outward\\n- Lung expands\\n- Lower pressure than outside body\\n- Diaphragm muscles contract, diaphragm flattens\\n- External intercostal muscles contract, pulling ribs up and out\\n\\n### (b) Exhalation\\n- Air pushed out of lungs\\n- Ribs move inward\\n- Lung contracts\\n- Higher pressure than outside body\\n- Diaphragm muscles relax, diaphragm becomes dome-shaped\\n- Internal intercostal muscles contract, pulling ribs down and in\\n\\n## KEY POINT\\n\\nIt is important that you remember the changes in volume and pressure during ventilation. If you have trouble understanding these, think of what happens when you use a bicycle pump. If you push the pump handle, the air in the pump is squashed, its pressure rises and it is forced out of the pump. If you pull on the handle, the air pressure inside the pump falls a little, and air is drawn in from outside. This is similar to what happens in the lungs. In exams, students sometimes talk about the lungs forcing the air in and out – they don't!\\n\\n## GAS EXCHANGE IN THE ALVEOLI\",\n",
       "  '## GAS EXCHANGE IN THE ALVEOLI\\n\\nYou can tell what is happening during gas exchange if you compare the amounts of different gases in atmospheric air with the air breathed out (Table 3.1).\\n\\n### Table 3.1 Approximate percentage volume of gases in atmospheric (inhaled) and exhaled air\\n\\n| Gas | Atmospheric air / % | Exhaled air / % |\\n|-----|---------------------|-----------------|\\n| nitrogen | 78 | 79 |\\n| oxygen | 21 | 16 |\\n| carbon dioxide | 0.04 | 4 |\\n| other gases (mainly argon) | 1 | 1 |\\n\\n### HINT\\n\\nBe careful when interpreting percentages! The percentage of a gas in a mixture can vary, even if the actual amount of the gas stays the same. This is easiest to understand from an example. Imagine you have a bottle containing a mixture of 20% oxygen and 80% nitrogen. If you used a chemical to absorb all the oxygen in the bottle, the nitrogen left would now be 100% of the gas in the bottle, despite the fact that the amount of nitrogen would still be the same. That is why the percentage of nitrogen in inhaled and exhaled air is slightly different.\\n\\nExhaled air is also warmer than atmospheric air, and is saturated with water vapour. The amount of water vapour in the atmosphere varies depending on weather conditions.',\n",
       "  \"Clearly, the lungs are absorbing oxygen into the blood and removing carbon dioxide from it. This happens in the alveoli. To do this efficiently, the alveoli must have a structure which brings the air and blood very close together, over a very large surface area. There are enormous numbers of alveoli. It has been calculated that the two lungs contain about 700,000,000 of these tiny air sacs, giving a total surface area of 60 m². That's bigger than the floor area of an average classroom! Viewed through a high-powered microscope, the alveoli look rather like bunches of grapes, and are covered with tiny blood capillaries (Figure 3.7).\\n---\\nANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY                            BREATHING AND GAS EXCHANGE                                                          39\\n\\nFigure 3.7 (a) Alveoli and the surrounding capillary network.

This statement is not correct - a cell wall is part of a plant cell! The correct way to describe the structure is: 'The alveolus has a wall made of cells'.\",\n",
       "  \"Deoxygenated blood is pumped from the heart to the lungs and passes through the capillaries surrounding the alveoli. The blood has come from the respiring tissues of the body, where it has given up some of its oxygen to the cells, and gained carbon dioxide. Around the lungs, the blood is separated from the air inside each alveolus by only two cell layers; the cells making up the wall of the alveolus, and the capillary wall itself. This is a distance of less than a thousandth of a millimetre.\\n\\n### EXTENSION WORK\\n\\nThe thin layer of fluid lining the inside of the alveoli comes from the blood. The capillaries and cells of the alveolar wall are 'leaky' and the blood pressure pushes fluid out from the blood plasma into the alveolus. Oxygen dissolves in this moist surface before it passes through the alveolar wall into the blood.\\n\\nBecause the air in the alveolus has a higher concentration of oxygen than the blood entering the capillary network, oxygen diffuses from the air, across the wall of the alveolus and into the blood. At the same time there is more carbon dioxide in the blood than there is in the air in the lungs. This means that there is a diffusion gradient for carbon dioxide in the other direction, so carbon dioxide diffuses the other way, out of the blood and into the alveolus. The result is that the blood which leaves the capillaries and flows back to the heart has gained oxygen and lost carbon dioxide. The heart then pumps the oxygenated blood around the body again, to supply the respiring cells (see Chapter 5).\\n---\\n40   ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY                       BREATHING AND GAS EXCHANGE\",\n",

Explain your reasoning.\\n\\n## THE EFFECTS OF SMOKING\\n\\nIn order for the lungs to exchange gases properly, the air passages need to be clear, the alveoli need to be free from dirt particles and bacteria, and they must have as big a surface area as possible in contact with the blood. There is one habit that can upset all of these conditions – smoking.',\n",
       "  \"Links between smoking and diseases of the lungs are now a proven fact. Smoking is associated with lung cancer, bronchitis and emphysema. It is also a major contributing factor to other conditions, such as coronary heart disease and ulcers of the stomach and intestine. Pregnant women who smoke are more likely to give birth to underweight babies.\\n\\nCoronary heart disease will be described in Chapter 5 after you have studied the structure of the heart. Here we will look at a number of other medical conditions that are caused by smoking.\\n\\n### EFFECTS OF SMOKE ON THE LINING OF THE AIR PASSAGES\\n\\nYou saw above how the lungs are kept free of particles of dirt and bacteria by the action of mucus and cilia. In the trachea and bronchi of a smoker, the cilia are destroyed by the chemicals in cigarette smoke.\\n---\\nThe reduced numbers of cilia mean that the mucus is not swept away from the lungs, but remains to block the air passages. This is made worse by the fact that the smoke irritates the lining of the airways, stimulating the cells to secrete more mucus. The sticky mucus blocking the airways is the source of 'smoker's cough'. Irritation of the bronchial tree, along with infections from bacteria in the mucus, can cause the lung disease bronchitis. Bronchitis blocks normal air flow, so the sufferer has difficulty breathing properly.\\n\\n## EMPHYSEMA\\n\\nEmphysema is another lung disease that kills about 20000 people in Britain every year. Smoking is the cause of one type of emphysema. Smoke damages the walls of the alveoli, which break down and fuse together again, forming enlarged, irregular air spaces (Figure 3.9).\",\n",
       "  'This greatly reduces the surface area for gas exchange, which becomes very inefficient. The blood of a person with emphysema carries less oxygen. In serious cases, this leads to the sufferer being unable to carry out even mild exercise, such as walking. Emphysema patients often have to have a supply of oxygen nearby at all times (Figure 3.10). There is no cure for emphysema, and usually the sufferer dies after a long and distressing illness.\\n\\n[Image description: Two diagrams showing alveoli in a normal lung and alveoli in the lung of a person suffering from emphysema. The normal lung shows many small, round alveoli, while the emphysema lung shows fewer, larger, and irregularly shaped air spaces.]\\n\\n### EXTENSION WORK\\n\\nA person who has chronic (long-term) bronchitis and emphysema is said to be suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. COPD is a progressive disease for which there is no cure.\\n\\nFigure 3.9 The alveoli of a person suffering from emphysema have a greatly reduced surface area and inefficient gas exchange.\\n\\nFigure 3.10 Patients with emphysema often need to breathe air enriched with oxygen in order to stay alive.\\n\\n## LUNG CANCER\\n\\nEvidence of the link between smoking and lung cancer first appeared in the 1950s. In one study, a number of patients in hospital were given a series of questions about their lifestyles. They were asked about their work, hobbies, housing and so on, including a question about how many cigarettes they smoked. The same questionnaire was given to two groups of patients. The first group were all suffering from lung cancer. The second (Control) group were in hospital with various other illnesses, but not lung cancer. To make it a fair comparison, the Control patients were matched with the lung cancer patients for sex, age and so on.',\n",

       "  '### CARBON MONOXIDE IN SMOKE\\n\\nOne of the harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke is the poisonous gas carbon monoxide. When this gas is breathed in with the smoke, it enters the bloodstream and interferes with the ability of the blood to carry oxygen. Oxygen is carried around in the blood in the red blood cells, attached to a chemical called haemoglobin (see Chapter 5). Carbon monoxide can combine with the haemoglobin much more tightly than oxygen can, forming a compound called carboxyhaemoglobin. The haemoglobin will combine with carbon monoxide in preference to oxygen. When this happens, the blood carries much less oxygen around the body. Carbon monoxide from smoking is also a major cause of heart disease (Chapter 5).\\n\\nIf a pregnant woman smokes, she will be depriving her unborn fetus of oxygen (Figure 3.14). This has an effect on its growth and development, and leads to the mass of the baby at birth being lower, on average, than the mass of babies born to non-smokers.\\n\\n### SOME SMOKING STATISTICS',\n",

If the current trend continues, by 2030 this will rise to 8 million deaths per year and 80% of these premature deaths will be in developing countries.\\n- Smoking causes almost 80% of deaths from lung cancer, 80% of deaths from bronchitis and emphysema, and 14% of deaths from heart disease.\\n- More than a quarter of all cancer deaths are attributable to smoking. These include cancer of the lung, mouth, lip, throat, bladder, kidney, pancreas, stomach, liver and cervix.\\n- While demand for tobacco has steadily fallen in developed countries like the UK, cigarette consumption is being increasingly concentrated in the developing world.\\n- 9.6 million adults in the UK smoke cigarettes, 20% of men and 17% of women. However, 22% of women and 30% of men in the UK are now ex-smokers. Surveys show that about two-thirds of current smokers would like to stop smoking.\\n- It is estimated that worldwide, 31% of men and 8% of women are smokers.

Large multinational tobacco companies have long been keen to enter the Chinese market.\\n- In China there are over a million deaths a year from smoking-related diseases. This figure is expected to double by 2025.\\n- In developing countries, smoking has a greater economic impact. Poorer smokers spend significant amounts of their income on cigarettes rather than necessities like food, healthcare and education.\\n- Tobacco farming uses up land that could be used for growing food crops.

The trouble is that the nicotine in tobacco is a very addictive drug, and causes withdrawal symptoms when people stop smoking. These include cravings for a cigarette, restlessness and a tendency to put on weight (nicotine depresses the appetite).\\n\\nThere are various ways that smokers can be helped to give up their habit. One method is 'vaping', which involves inhaling a vapour containing nicotine from an electronic cigarette or e-cigarette (Figure 3.15). Other methods use nicotine patches (Figure 3.16) or nicotine chewing gum. They all work in a similar way, providing the smoker with a source of nicotine without the harmful tar from cigarettes. The nicotine is absorbed by the body and reduces the craving for a cigarette. Gradually, the patient reduces the nicotine dose until they are weaned off the habit.\\n\\n### EXTENSION WORK\\n\\nYou could carry out an Internet search to find out about the different methods people use to help them give up smoking.

       "  '# 4 FOOD AND DIGESTION\\n\\nFood is essential for life. The nutrients obtained from it are used in many different ways by the body. This chapter looks at the different kinds of food, and how the food is broken down by the digestive system and absorbed into the blood, so that it can be carried to all the tissues of the body.\\n\\n## LEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n- Identify the chemical elements present in carbohydrates, proteins and lipids (fats and oils)\\n- Describe the structure of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids as large molecules made up from smaller basic units – starch and glycogen from simple sugars, protein from amino acids, and lipids from fatty acids and glycerol\\n- Investigate food samples for the presence of glucose, starch, protein and fat\\n- Understand that a balanced diet should include appropriate proportions of carbohydrate, protein, lipid, vitamins, minerals, water and dietary fibre\\n- Identify the sources and describe the functions of carbohydrate, lipid, protein, vitamins A, C and D, the mineral ions calcium and iron, water, and dietary fibre as components of the diet\\n- Understand how energy requirements vary with activity levels, age and pregnancy\\n- Describe the structure and function of the human alimentary canal, including the mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine (duodenum and ileum), large intestine (colon and rectum) and pancreas\\n- Understand how food is moved through the gut by peristalsis\\n- Understand the role of digestive enzymes, including the digestion of starch to glucose by amylase and maltase, the digestion of proteins to amino acids by proteases and the digestion of lipids to fatty acids and glycerol by lipases\\n- Understand that bile is produced by the liver and stored in the gall bladder, and understand the role of bile in neutralising stomach acid and emulsifying lipids\\n- Understand how the small intestine is adapted for absorption, including the structure of a villus\\n\\nWe need food for three main reasons:',\n",
       "  \"We need food for three main reasons:\\n\\n- to supply us with a 'fuel' for energy\\n- to provide materials for growth and repair of tissues\\n- to help fight disease and keep our bodies healthy.\\n\\n## A BALANCED DIET\\n\\nThe food that we eat is called our diet. No matter what you like to eat, your diet must include the following five groups of food substances if your body is to work properly and stay healthy – carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, minerals and vitamins – along with dietary fibre and water. Food should provide you with all of these substances, but they must also be present in the right amounts. A diet that provides enough of these substances and in the correct proportions to keep you healthy is called a balanced diet (Figure 4.1). We will look at each type of food in turn, to find out about its chemistry and the role that it plays in the body.\\n---\\nMARKDOWN_EXTRACTION_FAILED\\n---\\n## ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: FOOD AND DIGESTION\\n\\nFigure 4.3 shows various foods rich in lipids, including dairy, meat, cheese, and nuts.\\n\\ntemperature, but melts if you warm it up. On the other hand, plant lipids are usually liquid at room temperature, and are called oils. Meat, butter, cheese, milk, eggs and oily fish are all rich in animal fats, as well as foods fried in animal fat. Vegetable oils include many types used for cooking, such as olive oil, corn oil and rapeseed oil, as well as products made from oils, such as margarine (Figure 4.3).\\n\\nLipids make up about 10% of our body's mass. They form an essential part of the structure of all cells, and fat is deposited in certain parts of the body as a long-term store of energy, for example under the skin and around the heart and kidneys. The fat layer under the skin acts as insulation, reducing heat loss through the surface of the body. Fat around organs such as the kidneys also helps to protect them from mechanical damage.\",\n",
       "  \"The chemical 'building blocks' of lipids are two types of molecule called glycerol and fatty acids. Glycerol is an oily liquid. It is also known as glycerine, and is used in many types of cosmetics. In lipids, a molecule of glycerol is joined to three fatty acid molecules. There are many different fatty acid molecules, which give us the many different kinds of lipid found in food (Figure 4.4).\\n\\nAlthough lipids are an essential part of our diet, too much lipid is unhealthy, especially a type called saturated fat, and a lipid compound called cholesterol. These substances have been linked to heart disease (see Chapter 5).\\n\\nFigure 4.4 depicts lipids made up of a molecule of glycerol joined to three fatty acids. The many different fatty acids form the variable part of the molecule.\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\nCholesterol is a substance that the body gets from food such as eggs and meat, but we also make cholesterol in our liver. It is an essential part of all cells, but too much cholesterol causes heart disease.\\n\\n### DID YOU KNOW?\\nSaturated lipids (saturated fats) are more common in food from animal sources, such as meat and dairy products. 'Saturated' is a word used in chemistry, which means that the fatty acids of the lipids contain no double bonds. Other lipids are unsaturated, which means that their fatty acids contain double bonds. These are more common in plant oils. There is evidence that unsaturated lipids are healthier for us than saturated ones.\\n\\n## PROTEINS\\n\\nProteins make up about 18% of the mass of the body. This is the second largest percentage after water. All cells contain protein, so we need it for growth and repair of tissues. Many compounds in the body are made from protein, including enzymes.\",\n",
       "  \"Most foods contain some protein, but certain foods such as meat, fish, cheese and eggs are particularly rich in it. You will notice that these foods are animal products. Plant material generally contains less protein, but some foods, especially beans, peas and nuts, are richer in protein than others.\\n\\nHowever, we don't need much protein in our diet to stay healthy. Doctors recommend a maximum daily intake of about 70g. In more economically developed countries, people often eat far more protein than they need, whereas in many poorer countries a protein-deficiency disease called kwashiorkor is common (Figure 4.5).\\n\\nFigure 4.5 shows a child suffering from a lack of protein in his diet, a disease called kwashiorkor. His swollen belly is not due to a full stomach, but is caused by fluid collecting in the tissues. Other symptoms include loss of weight, poor muscle growth, general weakness and flaky skin.\\n\\nLike starch, proteins are also polymers, but whereas starch is made from a single molecular building block (glucose), proteins are made from 20 different sub-units called amino acids. All amino acids contain four chemical elements: carbon, hydrogen and oxygen (as in carbohydrates and fats) along with nitrogen. Two amino acids also contain sulfur. The amino acids are linked together in long chains, which are usually folded up or twisted into spirals, with cross-links holding the chains together (Figure 4.6).\\n---\\nANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY | FOOD AND DIGESTION\\n\\na) [A simple diagram showing a chain of different shapes representing amino acids]\\n\\nb) [A complex molecular model showing a protein structure with many interconnected spheres in various colors]\\n\\nFigure 4.6 (a) A chain of amino acids forming part of a protein molecule. Each shape represents a different amino acid. (b) A computer model of the protein insulin. This substance, like all proteins, is made of a long chain of amino acids arranged in a particular order and folded into a specific shape.\",\n",
       "  \"The shape of a protein is very important in allowing it to carry out its function, and the order of amino acids in the protein decides its shape. Because there are 20 different amino acids, and they can be arranged in any order, the number of different protein structures that can be made is enormous. As a result, there are thousands of different kinds of proteins in organisms, from structural proteins such as collagen and keratin in skin and nails, to proteins with more specific functions, such as enzymes and haemoglobin.\\n\\n## EXTENSION WORK\\n\\nHumans can make about half of the 20 amino acids that they need, but the other 10 have to be taken in as part of the diet. These 10 are called essential amino acids. There are higher amounts of essential amino acids in meat, fish, eggs and dairy products. If you are a vegetarian, you can still get all the essential amino acids you need, as long as you eat a varied diet that includes a range of different plant materials.\\n\\n## MINERALS\\n\\nAll the foods you have read about so far are made from just five chemical elements: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur. Our bodies contain many other elements that we get from our food as 'minerals' or 'mineral ions'. Some are present in large amounts in the body, for example calcium, which is used for making teeth and bones. Others are present in much smaller amounts, but still have essential jobs to do. For instance our bodies contain about 3g of iron, but without it our blood would not be able to carry oxygen. Table 4.1 shows just a few of these minerals and the reasons they are needed.\\n\\nTable 4.1 Some examples of minerals needed by the body:\",\n",

For example, a one-year-old child needs to consume about 0.6g (600 mg) of calcium every day, to make the bones grow properly and harden. Anything less than this over a prolonged period could result in poor bone development. The bones become deformed, a disease called rickets (Figure 4.7). Rickets can also be caused by lack of vitamin D in the diet (see below).\\n\\nSimilarly, 16-year-olds need about 12 mg of iron in their daily food intake. If they don't get this amount, they can't make enough haemoglobin for their red blood cells (see Chapter 5). This causes a condition called anaemia. People who are anaemic become tired and lack energy, because their blood doesn't carry enough oxygen.\\n\\nFigure 4.7 An x-ray of the legs of a child showing the symptoms of rickets.\\n\\n## VITAMINS\",\n",

When young laboratory rats were fed a diet of pure carbohydrate, lipid and protein, they all became ill and died. If they were fed on the same pure foods with a little added milk, they grew normally. The milk contained chemicals that the rats needed in small amounts to stay healthy. These chemicals are called vitamins. The results of one of these experiments are shown in Figure 4.8.\\n\\n| Time (days) | No milk | Fed milk | Milk stopped |\\n|-------------|---------|----------|--------------|\\n| 0           | 45      | 45       | -            |\\n| 10          | 50      | 65       | -            |\\n| 20          | 48      | 78       | 78           |\\n| 30          | 55      | 82       | 75           |\\n| 40          | 65      | 80       | 72           |\\n| 50          | 75      | 73       | 72           |\\n\\nFigure 4.8 Rats were fed a diet of pure carbohydrate, lipid and protein, with and without added milk. Vitamins in the milk had a dramatic effect on their growth.\\n\\nAt first, the chemical nature of vitamins was not known, and they were given letters to distinguish between them, such as vitamin A, vitamin B and so on. Each was identified by the effect a lack of the vitamin (vitamin deficiency) had on the body. For example, vitamin D is needed for growing bones to take up calcium salts. A deficiency of this vitamin can result in rickets (Figure 4.7), just as a lack of calcium can.',\n",

A drop of yellow-brown iodine solution is added to the starch. The iodine reacts with the starch, forming a very dark blue, or 'blue-black' colour (Figure 4.10 (a)). Starch is insoluble, but this test will work on a solid sample of food, such as potato, or a suspension of starch in water.\\n\\nFigure 4.10a Testing for starch using iodine\\n\\n### PRACTICAL: TEST FOR GLUCOSE\\n\\nGlucose is called a reducing sugar. This is because the test for glucose involves reducing an alkaline solution of copper (II) sulfate to copper (I) oxide.\\n\\nA small spatula measure of glucose is placed in a test tube and a little water added (about 2 cm deep). The tube is shaken to dissolve the glucose. Several drops of Benedict's solution are added to the tube, enough to colour the mixture blue (Figure 4.10 (b)).\\n\\nA water bath is prepared by half-filling a beaker with water and heating it on a tripod and gauze. The test tube is placed in the beaker and the water allowed to boil (using a water bath is safer than heating the tube directly in the Bunsen burner). After a few seconds the clear blue solution gradually changes colour, forming a cloudy orange or 'brick red' precipitate of copper (I) oxide (Figure 4.10 (b)).\",\n",
       "  \"All other 'single' sugars (monosaccharides), such as fructose, are reducing sugars, as well as some 'double' sugars (disaccharides), such as the milk sugar, lactose.

The tube is shaken to mix the powder with the water. An equal volume of dilute (5%) potassium hydroxide solution is added and the tube shaken again. Finally two drops of 1% copper sulfate solution are added. A purple colour develops. (Sometimes these two solutions are supplied already mixed together as 'biuret solution'.)\\n\\n### PRACTICAL: TEST FOR LIPID\\n\\nFats and oils are insoluble in water, but will dissolve in ethanol (alcohol). The test for lipid uses this fact.\\n\\nA pipette is used to place one drop of olive oil in the bottom of a test tube. About 2cm depth of ethanol is added, and the tube is shaken to dissolve the oil. The solution is poured into a test tube that is about three-quarters full with cold water. A white cloudy layer forms on the top of the water. The white layer is caused by the ethanol dissolving in the water and leaving the lipid behind as a suspension of tiny droplets, called an emulsion.\\n---\\nANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY                          FOOD AND DIGESTION     55\\n\\n![Image of a can of baked beans with nutritional information]\\n\\nFigure 4.11 Food packaging is labelled with the proportions of different food types that it contains, along with its energy content.

It is simplified so that you can see the order of the organs along the gut. The real gut is much longer than this, and coiled up so that it fills the whole space of the abdomen. Overall, its length in an adult is about 8m. This gives plenty of time for the food to be broken down and absorbed as it passes through the gut.\\n\\n[A diagram of the human digestive system is shown, with the following parts labeled:]\\n\\n- Salivary gland\\n- Mouth\\n- Tongue\\n- Oesophagus (gullet)\\n- Trachea (wind pipe)\\n- Liver\\n- Stomach\\n- Gall bladder\\n- Pancreas\\n- Small intestine:\\n  - Duodenum\\n  - Ileum\\n- Large intestine:\\n  - Colon\\n  - Rectum\\n- Appendix\\n- Anus\\n\\nThe mouth, stomach and the first part of the small intestine (called the duodenum) all break down the food using enzymes, either made in the gut wall itself, or by glands such as the pancreas. Digestion continues in the last part of the small intestine (the ileum) and it is here that the digested food is absorbed. The last part of the gut, the large intestine, is mainly concerned with absorbing water out of the remains, and storing the waste products (faeces) before they are removed from the body.\\n---\\n ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY                           FOOD AND DIGESTION                                                                 59',\n",

These are made by the pancreas, and digest starch, proteins and lipids (Table 4.5). As well as this, the liver makes a digestive juice called bile. Bile is a green liquid that is stored in the gall bladder and passes down the bile duct on to the food. Bile does not contain enzymes, but has another important function. It turns any large lipid globules in the food into an emulsion of tiny droplets (Figure 4.16). This increases the surface area of the lipid, so that lipase enzymes can break it down more easily.\\n\\nBile and pancreatic juice have another function. They are both alkaline. The mixture of semi-digested food and enzymes coming from the stomach is acidic, and needs to be neutralised by the addition of alkali before it continues on its way through the gut.\\n\\nAs the food continues along the intestine, more enzymes are added, until the parts of the food that can be digested have been fully broken down into soluble end products, which can be absorbed. This is the role of the last part of the small intestine, the ileum.\\n\\nFigure 4.16 Bile turns fats into an emulsion of tiny droplets for easier digestion.\\n\\n## ABSORPTION IN THE ILEUM',\n",
       "  \"## ABSORPTION IN THE ILEUM\\n\\nThe ileum is highly adapted to absorb the digested food. The lining of the ileum has a very large surface area, which means that it can quickly and efficiently absorb the soluble products of digestion into the blood. The length of the intestine helps to provide a large surface area, and this is aided by folds in its lining, but the greatest increase in area is due to tiny projections from the lining, called villi (Figure 4.17).\\n\\nFigure 4.17 (a) The inside lining of the ileum is adapted to absorb digested food by the presence of millions of tiny villi. (b) Photo of the inside a patient's ileum, taken using a camera attached to an endoscope. You can see thousands of tiny villi covering the lining.\\n\\nThe singular of villi is 'villus'. Each villus is only about 1-2 mm long, but there are millions of them, so that the total area of the lining is thought to be about 300 m². This provides a massive area in contact with the digested food. As well as this, high-powered microscopy has revealed that the surface cells of each villus themselves have hundreds of minute projections, called microvilli, which increase the surface area for absorption even more (Figure 4.18).\\n\\nEach villus contains a network of blood capillaries. Most of the digested food enters these blood vessels, but the products of fat digestion, as well as tiny fat droplets, enter a tube in the middle of the villus, called a lacteal. The lacteals form part of the body's lymphatic system, which transports a liquid called lymph. This lymph eventually drains into the blood system too.\\n---\\nANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY                         FOOD AND DIGESTION                                                              61\\n\\nDiagram of a villus structure\\n\\nFigure 4.18 Each villus contains blood vessels and a lacteal, which absorb the products of digestion. The surface cells of the villus are covered with microvilli, which further increase the surface area for absorption.\",\n",
       "  'The surface of a villus is made of a single layer of cells called an epithelium. This means that there is only a short distance between the digested food in the ileum and the blood capillaries making it easier for the products of digestion to diffuse through and enter the blood. The epithelium cells contain many mitochondria, which supply the energy needed for active transport of some substances.\\n\\nIn addition each villus contains muscle fibres which contract to move the villus. The villi are in constant motion, keeping them in contact with the contents of the ileum and maintaining a steep concentration gradient for diffusion of the products of digestion.\\n\\nThe blood vessels from the ileum join up to form a large blood vessel called the hepatic portal vein, which leads to the liver (see Chapter 5). The liver acts rather like a food processing factory, breaking some molecules down, and building up and storing others. For example, glucose from carbohydrate digestion is converted into glycogen and stored in the liver. Later, the glycogen can be converted back into glucose when the body needs it (see Chapter 7).\\n\\nThe digested food molecules are distributed around the body by the blood system (see Chapter 5). The soluble food molecules are absorbed from the blood into cells of tissues, and are used to build new parts of cells. This is called assimilation.\\n\\n## KEY POINT\\n\\nRemoval of faeces by the body is sometimes incorrectly called excretion. Excretion is a word that only applies to materials that are the waste products of cells of the body, such as carbon dioxide. Faeces are not products of cell metabolism - they consist of waste that has passed through the gut and left the body via the anus, without entering the cells. The correct name for this process is egestion.\\n\\n## THE LARGE INTESTINE – ELIMINATION OF WASTE',\n",
       "  '## THE LARGE INTESTINE – ELIMINATION OF WASTE\\n\\nBy the time that the contents of the gut have reached the end of the small intestine, most of the digested food, as well as most of the water, has been absorbed. The waste material consists mainly of cellulose (fibre) and other indigestible remains, water, dead and living bacteria and cells lost from the lining of the gut. The function of the first part of the large intestine, called the colon, is to absorb most of the remaining water from the contents, leaving a semi-solid waste material called faeces. This is stored in the rectum, until expelled out of the body through the anus.\\n---\\n   |          |\\n   |          |\\n   |          | <-- distilled water\\n   |          |\\n   |          | <-- mixture of starch\\n   |          |     and glucose\\n   |          |\\n   |          | <-- Visking tubing bag\\n   |          |\\n   |          |\\n   \\n---\\nANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY                       FOOD AND DIGESTION                                                           63\\n\\nSKILLS > DECISION MAKING\\n\\n6 A student carried out an experiment to find out the best conditions for the enzyme pepsin to digest protein.

It also distributes heat around the body.\\n\\nSingle-celled organisms, like the ones shown in Figure 5.2, do not have circulatory systems.\\n---\\n# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY BLOOD AND CIRCULATION 65\\n\\n![Human circulatory system diagram with labeled parts]\\n\\npulmonary\\nvein | pulmonary\\nartery\\n\\nheart\\nvena | aorta\\ncava\\n\\n![Amoeba diagram] | ![Paramecium diagram] | ![Euglena diagram]\\nAmoeba | Paramecium | Euglena\\n\\n▲ Figure 5.2 Unicellular organisms do not have circulatory systems.\\n\\nThere is no circulatory system to carry materials around the very small 'bodies' of these single-celled organisms. Materials can easily move around the cell without a special system. There is no need for lungs or gills to obtain oxygen from the environment either. Single-celled organisms obtain oxygen by diffusion through the surface membrane of the cell. The rest of the cell then uses the oxygen. The area of the cell's surface determines how much oxygen the organism can get (the supply rate), and the volume of the cell determines how much oxygen the organism uses (the demand rate).\\n\\noxygenated\\nblood\\n\\ndeoxygenated\\nblood\\n\\nThe ratio of supply to demand can be written as: surface area\\nvolume\\n\\n▲ Figure 5.1 The human circulatory system.\\n\\nThis is called the 'surface area to volume ratio' and it is affected by the size of an organism (see Chapter 1, Activity 4). Single-celled organisms have a high surface area to volume ratio. Their cell surface membrane has a large enough area to supply all the oxygen that their volume demands. In larger animals, the surface area to volume ratio is lower.\",\n",
       "  \"Large animals cannot get all the oxygen they need through their surface (even if the body surface would allow it to pass through) – there just isn't enough surface to supply all that volume. To overcome this problem, large organisms have evolved special gas exchange organs and circulatory systems. The gills of fish and the lungs of mammals are linked to a circulatory system that carries oxygen to all parts of the body. The same idea applies to obtaining nutrients – the gut obtains nutrients from food and the circulatory system distributes the nutrients around the body.\\n\\n## THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS OF DIFFERENT ANIMALS\\n\\nOne of the main functions of a circulatory system in animals is to transport oxygen. Blood is pumped to a gas exchange organ to load oxygen. It is then pumped to other parts of the body where it unloads the oxygen. There are two main types of circulatory systems in animals.\\n\\n■ In a single circulatory system the blood is pumped from the heart to the gas exchange organ and then directly to the rest of the body.\\n\\n■ In a double circulatory system the blood is pumped from the heart to the gas exchange organ, back to the heart and then to the rest of the body.\\n\\nFigure 5.3 shows the difference between these systems.\\n---\\n66   ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY                       BLOOD AND CIRCULATION\\n\\n![Diagram showing circulatory systems of fish and human]\\n\\nFigure 5.3 (a) The single circulatory system of a fish. The blood passes through the heart only once in a complete circuit of the body. (b) The double circulatory system of a human (and other mammals). The blood passes through the heart twice in one complete circuit of the body.\\n\\nThere are two parts to a double circulatory system:\\n\\n- The pulmonary circulation. Deoxygenated blood leaves the heart through the pulmonary arteries, and is circulated through the lungs, where it becomes oxygenated. The oxygenated blood returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins.\",\n",
       "  \"- The systemic circulation. Oxygenated blood leaves the heart through the aorta and is circulated through all other parts of the body, where it unloads its oxygen. Deoxygenated blood returns to the heart through the vena cava.\\n\\nA double circulatory system is more efficient than a single circulatory system. The heart pumps the blood twice, so higher pressures can be maintained. The blood travels more quickly to organs. In the single circulatory system of a fish, blood loses pressure as it passes through the gills. It then travels more slowly to the other organs.\\n\\nThe human circulatory system comprises:\\n- the heart - this is a pump\\n- blood vessels - these carry the blood around the body; arteries carry blood away from the heart and towards other organs, veins carry blood towards the heart and away from other organs and capillaries carry blood through organs, linking the arteries and veins\\n- blood - the transport medium.\\n\\nFigure 5.4 shows the main blood vessels in the human circulatory system.\\n\\n> KEY POINT\\n> \\n> 'Pulmonary' means 'relating to the lungs'.\\n\\n> DID YOU KNOW?\\n> \\n> There are actually two vena cavae (the plural of vena cava).

       "  \"## CORONARY HEART DISEASE\\n\\nThe coronary arteries are among the narrowest in the body. They are easily blocked by a build-up of fatty substances (including cholesterol) in their walls. This can cut off the blood supply to an area of cardiac muscle. The affected muscle can no longer receive oxygen and glucose, so it cannot respire and release energy. This means it is unable to contract, resulting in a heart attack. This is called coronary heart disease (CHD). It can lead to severe health problems and is often fatal.\\n\\n[A diagram of a heart showing coronary arteries, a blocked coronary artery, and a region deprived of oxygen]\\n\\nFigure 5.7 A blockage of a coronary artery cuts off the blood supply to part of the heart muscle.\\n\\nA number of factors make coronary heart disease more likely:\\n\\n- heredity – some people inherit a tendency to develop coronary heart disease\\n- high blood pressure – puts more strain on the heart\\n- diet – eating large amounts of saturated fat is likely to raise cholesterol levels\\n- smoking – raises blood pressure and makes blood clots more likely to form\\n- stress – raises blood pressure\\n- lack of exercise – regular exercise helps to reduce blood pressure and strengthens the heart.\\n\\n## HEART RATE\\n\\nNormally the heart beats about 70 times a minute, but this can change according to the needs of the body. When we exercise, muscles must release more energy. They need an increased supply of oxygen for aerobic respiration (see Chapter 1). To deliver the extra oxygen, both the number of beats per minute (heart rate) and the volume of blood pumped with each beat (called stroke volume) increase.\\n\\nWhen we are angry or afraid our heart rate again increases. The increased output supplies extra blood to the muscles, enabling them to release extra energy through aerobic respiration. This allows us to fight or run away and is called the 'fight or flight' response. It is triggered by secretion of the hormone adrenaline from the adrenal glands (see Chapter 7).\",\n",
       "  \"When we sleep, our heart rate decreases as all our organs are working more slowly.

The walls of capillaries are one cell thick, providing a short distance for diffusion of materials into and out of the blood. Red blood cells just fit through the tiny diameter of capillaries, so they are close to the capillary wall. This means that there is a short distance for oxygen to diffuse.

They have a limited life span of about 100 days after which time they are destroyed in the spleen. They have only one function – to transport oxygen. Several features enable them to carry out this function very efficiently.\\n\\nRed blood cells contain haemoglobin. This is an iron-containing protein that associates (combines) with oxygen to form oxyhaemoglobin when there is a high concentration of oxygen in the surroundings. We say that the red blood cell is loading oxygen. When the concentration of oxygen is low, oxyhaemoglobin turns back into haemoglobin and the red blood cell unloads its oxygen.',\n",

As they pass through active tissues they unload oxygen.\\n\\n| haemoglobin + oxygen | in the lungs → | oxyhaemoglobin |\\n|----------------------|----------------|-----------------|\\n|                      | in the tissues ← |                 |\\n\\nRed blood cells do not contain a nucleus. It is lost during their development in the bone marrow. This means that more haemoglobin can be packed into each red blood cell so more oxygen can be transported. Their biconcave shape allows efficient exchange of oxygen in and out of the cell. Each red blood cell has a high surface area to volume ratio, giving a large area for diffusion. The thin shape of the cell results in a short diffusion distance to the centre of the cell.\\n\\n## WHITE BLOOD CELLS\\n\\nThere are several types of white blood cell. Their main role is to protect the body against invasion by disease-causing microorganisms (pathogens), such as bacteria and viruses. They do this in two main ways: phagocytosis and production of antibodies.\\n\\nAbout 70% of white blood cells can ingest (take in) microorganisms such as bacteria. This is called phagocytosis, and the cells are phagocytes. They do this by changing their shape, producing extensions of their cytoplasm, called pseudopodia. The pseudopodia surround and enclose the microorganism in a vacuole. Once it is inside, the phagocyte secretes enzymes into the vacuole to break the microorganism down (Figure 5.14). Phagocytosis means 'cell eating' – you can see why it is called this.\\n\\nApproximately 25% of white blood cells are lymphocytes. Their function is to make chemicals called antibodies. Antibodies are soluble proteins that pass into the plasma. Pathogens such as bacteria and viruses have chemical 'markers' on their surfaces, which the antibodies recognise. These markers are called antigens. The antibodies stick to the surface antigens and destroy the pathogen. They do this in a number of ways, for example by:\",\n",

The potential inside the\\n                                             axon is about -70 mV lower than outside: This 'resting potential' is caused\\n                                             by differences in concentrations of various ions inside and outside the cell:\\n                                             When the cell is stimulated, sodium ions (Nat) rush into the axon through\\n                                             the membrane: The inflow of positively charged ions causes the potential\\n                                             to become positive    wesaythat it is depolarised.

It also deals with another important aspect of homeostasis – maintaining a steady body temperature.\\n\\n## LEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n- Understand that homeostasis is the maintenance of a constant internal environment\\n- Understand that control of body water content and body temperature are examples of homeostasis\\n- Know the excretory products of the lungs, kidneys and skin\\n- Understand the origin of carbon dioxide and oxygen as waste products of metabolism and their loss from the stomata of a leaf\\n- Describe the role of the skin in temperature regulation, with reference to sweating, vasoconstriction and vasodilation\\n\\nInside our bodies, conditions are kept relatively constant. This is called **homeostasis**. The kidneys are organs which have a major role to play in both homeostasis and in the removal of waste products, or **excretion**. They filter the blood, removing substances and controlling the concentration of water and solutes (dissolved substances) in the blood and other body fluids.\\n\\n## HOMEOSTASIS\\n\\n| KEY POINT |\\n|-----------|\\n| The meaning of 'homeostasis' is 'keeping the conditions in the internal environment of the body relatively constant'. One aspect of homeostasis is the maintenance of the water and salt content of the internal environment. This is called osmoregulation. |\",\n",
       "  \"If you were to drink a litre of water and wait for half an hour, your body would soon respond to this change by producing about the same volume of urine. In other words, it would automatically balance your water input and water loss. Drinking is the main way that our bodies gain water, but there are other sources (Figure 8.1). Some water is present in the food that we eat, and a small amount is formed by cell respiration. The body also loses water, mostly in urine, but also smaller volumes in sweat, faeces and exhaled air. Every day, we gain and lose about the same volume of water, so that the total content of our bodies stays more or less the same. This is an example of homeostasis. The word 'homeostasis' means 'steady state', and refers to keeping conditions inside the body relatively constant.\\n\\nThe inside of the body is known as the **internal environment**. You have probably heard of the 'environment', which means the 'surroundings' of an organism. The internal environment is the surroundings of the cells inside the body. It particularly means the blood, together with another liquid called **tissue fluid**.\\n---\\n\\n## Figure 8.1 The daily water balance of an adult\\n\\n| Water Gain        | Amount    | Water Loss        | Amount    |\\n|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|\\n| Food              | 800 cm³   | Exhaled air       | 400 cm³   |\\n| Drink             | 1400 cm³  | Sweat             | 600 cm³   |\\n| Cell respiration  | 400 cm³   | Urine             | 1500 cm³  |\\n|                   |           | Faeces            | 100 cm³   |\\n| Total             | 2600 cm³  | Total             | 2600 cm³  |\\n\\nTissue fluid is a watery solution of salts, glucose and other solutes. It surrounds all the cells of the body, forming a pathway for the transfer of nutrients between the blood and the cells. Tissue fluid is formed by leakage from blood capillaries. It is similar in composition to blood plasma, but lacks the plasma proteins.\",\n",
       "  \"It is not just water and salts that are kept constant in the body. Many other components of the internal environment are maintained. For example, the level of carbon dioxide in the blood is regulated, along with the blood pH, the concentration of dissolved glucose (see Chapter 7) and the body temperature.\\n\\nHomeostasis is important because cells will only function properly if they are bathed in a tissue fluid which provides them with their optimum conditions. For instance, if the tissue fluid contains too many solutes, the cells will lose water by osmosis, and become dehydrated. If the tissue fluid is too dilute, the cells will swell up with water. Both conditions will prevent them working efficiently and might cause permanent damage. If the pH of the tissue fluid is not correct, it will affect the activity of the cell's enzymes, as will a body temperature much different from 37 °C. It is also important that excretory products are removed. Substances such as urea must be prevented from building up in the blood and tissue fluid, where they would be toxic to cells.\\n\\n### DID YOU KNOW?\\n'Salts' in urine or in the blood are present as ions. For example, the sodium chloride in Table 8.1 will be in solution as sodium ions (Na+) and chloride ions (Cl-). Urine contains many other ions, such as potassium (K+), phosphate (HPO₄²⁻) and ammonium (NH₄+), and removes excess ions from the blood.\\n\\n## URINE\\n\\nAn adult human produces about 1.5 dm³ of urine every day, although this volume depends very much on the amount of water drunk and the volume lost in other forms, such as sweat. Every litre of urine contains about 40g of waste products and salts (Table 8.1).\\n\\n---\\nMARKDOWN_EXTRACTION_FAILED\\n---\\nThe real difference between homeotherms and all other animals is that homeotherms can keep their temperatures constant by using physiological changes for generating or losing heat. For this reason, mammals and birds are also called 'endotherms', meaning 'heat from inside'.\",\n",
       "  \"An endotherm uses heat from the chemical reactions in its cells to warm its body. It then controls its heat loss by regulating processes like sweating and blood flow through the skin. Endotherms use behavioural ways to control their temperature too. For example, penguins 'huddle' together in groups to keep warm, and humans put on extra clothes in winter.\\n\\nWhat is the advantage of a human maintaining a body temperature of 37°C? It means that all the chemical reactions taking place in the cells of the body can go on at a steady, predictable rate. The metabolism doesn't slow down in cold environments. If you watch goldfish in a garden pond, you will notice that in summer, when the pond water is warm, they are very active, swimming about quickly. In winter, when the temperature drops, the fish slow down and become very sluggish in their actions. This would happen to a mammal too, if its body temperature varied.\\n\\nIt is also important that the body does not become too hot. The cells' enzymes work best at 37°C. At higher temperatures enzymes, like all proteins, are destroyed by denaturing (see Chapter 1). Endotherms have all evolved a body temperature of around 40°C (Table 8.2) and enzymes that work best at this temperature.\\n\\nTable 8.2 The body temperatures of a range of mammals and birds\",\n",

This is located in the hypothalamus of the brain. It acts as the body's 'thermostat'.\\n\\nIf a person goes into a warm or cold environment, the first thing that happens is that temperature receptors in the skin send electrical impulses to the hypothalamus, which stimulates the brain to alter our behaviour. We start to feel hot or cold, and usually do something about it, such as finding shade, having a cold drink, or putting on more clothes.\",\n",

This change needs energy, called the latent heat of vaporisation: When\\n---\\nsweat evaporates, the energy is supplied by the body's heat, cooling the body\\ndown. It is not that the sweat is cool - it is secreted at body temperature. It\\nonly has a cooling action when it evaporates. In very humid atmospheres (e.g.\\na tropical rainforest) the sweat stays on the skin and doesn't evaporate. It then\\nhas very little cooling effect.\",\n",
       "  \"Secondly, hairs on the surface of the skin lie flat against the skin's surface.\\nThis happens because of the relaxation of tiny muscles called hair erector\\nmuscles attached to the base of each hair. In cold conditions, these contract\\nand the hairs are pulled upright. The hairs trap a layer of air next to the skin, and\\nsince air is a poor conductor of heat, this acts as insulation. In warm conditions,\\nthe thinner layer of trapped air means that more heat will be lost. This is not\\nvery effective in humans, because the hairs over most of our body do not grow\\nvery large. It is very effective in hairy mammals like cats or dogs. The same\\nprinciple is used by birds, which 'fluff out' their feathers in cold weather.\\n\\nLastly, there are tiny blood vessels called capillary loops in the dermis. Blood\\nflows through these loops, radiating heat to the outside, and cooling the body\\ndown. If the body is too hot, arterioles (small arteries) leading to the capillary\\nloops dilate (widen). This increases the blood flow to the skin's surface\\n(Figure 8.4) and is called vasodilation.\\n\\n| Vasodilation | Vasoconstriction |\\n|--------------|------------------|\\n| More heat radiated | Less heat radiated |\\n| Capillary loops in skin visible | Capillary loops less visible |\\n| Blood vessels dilate | Blood vessels constrict |\\n| Blood flows through surface vessels | Blood flows through deeper vessels |\\n\\nFigure 8.4 Blood flow through the surface of the skin is controlled by vasodilation or\\nvasoconstriction.\\n\\nIn cold conditions, the opposite happens. The arterioles leading to the surface\\ncapillary loops constrict (become narrower) and blood flow to the surface of\\nthe skin is reduced, so that less heat is lost. This is called vasoconstriction.\\nVasoconstriction and vasodilation are brought about by tiny rings of muscles\\nin the walls of the arterioles, called sphincter muscles, like the sphincters you\\nread about earlier in this chapter, at the outlet of the bladder.\",\n",
       "  \"There are other ways that the body can control heat loss and heat gain. In cold\\nconditions, the body's metabolism speeds up, generating more heat.

       "  '# 9 REPRODUCTION IN HUMANS\\n\\nOne of the characteristics of living organisms that makes them different from non-living things is their ability to produce offspring, or reproduce. Reproduction is all about an organism passing on its genes. This can be through special sex cells, or gametes. It can also be asexually, without the production of gametes. In this chapter we look at the differences between sexual and asexual reproduction, and study in detail the process of human reproduction.\\n\\n## LEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n- Understand the differences between sexual and asexual reproduction\\n- Understand that fertilisation involves the fusion of a male and female gamete to produce a zygote\\n- Understand that a zygote undergoes cell division and develops into an embryo\\n- Understand how the structure and function of the human male and female reproductive systems are adapted for their functions\\n- Describe the role of the placenta in the nutrition of the developing embryo\\n- Understand how the developing embryo is protected by amniotic fluid\\n- Understand the roles of oestrogen and testosterone in the development of secondary sexual characteristics\\n- Understand the roles of oestrogen and progesterone in the menstrual cycle\\n\\n## SEXUAL AND ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION COMPARED\\n\\nIn any method of reproduction, the end result is the production of more organisms of the same species. Humans produce more humans, pea plants produce more pea plants and salmonella bacteria produce more salmonella bacteria. However, the way in which they reproduce differs. There are two types of reproduction: sexual reproduction and asexual reproduction.\\n\\nIn sexual reproduction, specialised sex cells called gametes are produced. There are usually two types, a mobile male gamete called a sperm and a stationary female gamete called an egg cell or ovum (plural ova).',\n",
       "  \"The sperm must move to the egg and fuse (join) with it. This is called fertilisation (Figure 9.1). The single cell formed by fertilisation is called a zygote. This cell will divide many times by mitosis to form all the cells of the new animal.\\n\\nIn asexual reproduction, there are no specialised gametes and there is no fertilisation. Instead, cells in one part of the body divide by mitosis to form a structure that breaks away from the parent body and grows into a new organism. Not many animals reproduce in this way. Figure 9.2 shows Hydra (a small animal similar to jellyfish) reproducing by budding. Cells in the body wall divide to form a small version of the adult. This eventually breaks off and becomes a free-living Hydra. One animal may produce several 'buds' in a short space of time.\\n\\n**KEY POINT**\\nIndividuals produced asexually from the same adult organism are called clones.\\n---\\n# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: REPRODUCTION IN HUMANS\\n\\n## KEY POINT\\n\\nA gene is a section of DNA that determines a particular characteristic or feature. Genes are found in the nucleus of a cell on the chromosomes (see Chapter 18).\\n\\nAll the offspring produced from Hydra buds are genetically identical – they have exactly the same genes. This is because all the cells of the new individual are produced by mitosis from just one cell in the body of the adult. When cells divide by mitosis, the new cells that are produced are exact copies of the original cell (see Chapter 17 for a description of mitosis). As a result, all the cells of an organism that are produced asexually have the same genes as the cell that produced them – the original adult cell. So all asexually produced offspring from one adult will have the same genes as the cells of the adult. They will all be genetic copies of that adult and so will be identical to each other.\",\n",
       "  'Asexual reproduction is useful to a species when the environment in which it lives is relatively stable. If an organism is well adapted to this stable environment, asexual reproduction will produce offspring that are also well adapted. However, if the environment changes significantly, then all the individuals will be affected equally by the change. It may be such a dramatic change that none of the individuals are adapted well enough to survive. The species will die out in that area.\\n\\n## SEXUAL REPRODUCTION\\n\\nThere are four stages in any method of sexual reproduction:\\n\\n- Gametes (sperm and egg cells) are produced.\\n- The male gamete (sperm) is transferred to the female gamete (egg cell).\\n- Fertilisation must occur – the sperm fuses with the egg.\\n- The zygote formed develops into a new individual.\\n\\nThe offspring produced by sexual reproduction show a great deal of genetic variation as a result of both gamete production and fertilisation.\\n\\n## PRODUCTION OF GAMETES\\n\\nSperm are produced in the male sex organs – the testes. Eggs are produced in the female sex organs – the ovaries. Both are produced when cells inside these organs divide. These cells do not divide by mitosis but by meiosis (see Chapter 17). Meiosis produces cells that are not genetically identical and have only half the number of chromosomes as the original cell.\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\n\\nCells that have the full number of chromosomes are called diploid cells. Cells that only have half the normal number of chromosomes are called haploid cells.\\n\\n## TRANSFER OF THE SPERM TO THE EGG\\n\\nSperm are specialised for swimming. They have a tail-like flagellum that moves them through a fluid. Figure 9.3 shows the structure of a sperm.',\n",
       "  'Some male animals, such as those of most fish, release their sperm into the water in which they live. The female animals release their eggs into the water and the sperm then swim through the water to fertilise the eggs. This is called external fertilisation as it takes place outside the body. Before the release takes place, there is usually some mating behaviour to ensure that male and female are in the same place at the same time. This gives the best chance of fertilisation occurring before water currents sweep the sex cells away.\\n---\\n106   ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY                         REPRODUCTION IN HUMANS\\n\\n                                                                                            sac 0f enzymes to\\n                                                                         head               penetrate membrane\\n                                                                                            around egg\\n                                                                     mid-piece              nucleus\\n                                                                                            mitochondria to\\n                                                                                            release energy\\n                                                                                            for movement\\n\\n                                                                           tail\\n                                                                   (flagellum)\\n                                                                for propulsion',\n",

       "  \"Each month, an egg is released into an oviduct from one of the ovaries. (The oviduct is also known as the Fallopian tube.) This is called ovulation. If an egg is present in the oviduct, then it may be fertilised by sperm introduced during intercourse. The zygote formed will begin to develop into an embryo, which will implant in the lining of the uterus. Here, the embryo will develop a placenta, which will allow the embryo to obtain materials such as oxygen and nutrients from the mother's blood. It also allows the embryo to get rid of waste products such as urea and carbon dioxide, as well as anchoring the embryo in the uterus. The placenta secretes female hormones, in particular progesterone, which maintain the pregnancy and prevent the embryo from aborting (being rejected by the mother's body). Figure 9.8 shows the structure and position of the placenta.\\n\\n## Figure 9.8 The position of the fetus just before birth, and the structure of the placenta\\n\\n### Left image\\n- umbilical cord\\n- placenta\\n\\n### Right image\\n- maternal blood vessels\\n- chorionic villi\\n- pool of mother's blood\\n- umbilical cord\\n- umbilical artery (carries deoxygenated blood containing waste products from fetus to placenta)\\n- umbilical vein (carries oxygenated blood containing nutrients from placenta to fetus)\\n- membrane separating blood of mother and fetus (baby)\\n---\\nDuring pregnancy, a membrane called the amnion encloses the developing embryo. The amnion secretes a fluid called amniotic fluid, which protects the developing embryo against sudden movements and bumps. As the embryo develops, it becomes more and more complex. When it becomes recognisably human, we no longer call it an embryo but a fetus. At the end of nine months of development, there just isn't any room left for the fetus to grow and it sends a hormonal 'signal' to the mother to begin the birth process. Figure 9.8 also shows the position of a human fetus just before birth.\\n\\nThere are three stages to the birth of a child:\",\n",
       "  \"There are three stages to the birth of a child:\\n\\n1. Dilation of the cervix. The cervix is the 'neck' of the uterus. It gets wider to allow the baby to pass through. The muscles of the uterus contract quite strongly and tears the amnion, allowing the amniotic fluid to escape. (In some countries the woman describes this as 'her waters have broken'.)\\n\\n2. Delivery of the baby. Strong contractions of the muscles of the uterus push the baby's head through the cervix and then through the vagina to the outside world.\\n\\n3. Delivery of the afterbirth. After the baby has been born, the uterus continues to contract and pushes the placenta out, together with the membranes that surrounded the baby. These are known as the afterbirth.\\n\\nFigure 9.9 shows the stages of birth.\\n\\n| Stage | Description |\\n|-------|-------------|\\n| 1 | Baby's head pushes cervix; mucous plug dislodges and waters break. |\\n| 2 | Uterus contracts to push baby out through the vagina. |\\n| 3 | The placenta becomes detached from the wall of the uterus and is expelled through the vagina as the afterbirth. |\\n\\n## HORMONES CONTROLLING REPRODUCTION\\n\\nMost animals are unable to reproduce when they are young. We say that they are sexually immature. When a baby is born, it is recognisable as a boy or girl by its sex organs.\\n\\nThe presence of male or female sex organs is known as the primary sex characteristics. During their teens, changes happen to boys and girls that lead to sexual maturity. These changes are controlled by hormones, and the time when they happen is called puberty. Puberty involves two developments. The first is that the gametes (eggs and sperm) start to mature and be released. The second is that the bodies of both sexes adapt to allow reproduction to take place. These events are started by hormones released by the pituitary gland.\",\n",
       "  \"In boys, these pituitary hormones stimulate sperm production and instruct the testes to secrete the male sex hormone, testosterone. Testosterone controls the development of the male secondary sexual characteristics. These include growth of the penis and testes, growth of facial and body hair, muscle\\n\\n> DID YOU KNOW?\\n> \\n> Just before birth, the fetus takes up so much room that many of the mother's organs are moved out of position. The heart is pushed upwards and rotates so that the base points towards the left breast.\\n\\n> DID YOU KNOW?\\n> \\n> Sperm production is most efficient at a temperature of about 34 °C, just below the core body temperature (37 °C). This is why the testes are outside the body in the scrotum, where the temperature is a little lower.\\n---\\n110   ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY                            REPRODUCTION IN HUMANS\\n\\n                                                  development and breaking of the voice (Table 9.1).\\n                                                  In girls, the pituitary hormones control the release of a female sex hormone\\n                                                  called oestrogen; from the ovaries.

This change is brought about by the hormone oestrogen, which is secreted by the ovaries.\\n\\nAfter the egg has been released, it travels down the oviduct to the uterus. It is here in the oviduct that fertilisation may happen, if sexual intercourse has taken place. What's left of the follicle now forms a structure in the ovary called the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum makes another hormone called progesterone. Progesterone completes the development of the uterus lining, by thickening and maintaining it, ready for the fertilised egg to sink into it and develop into an embryo.\\n\\nIf the egg is not fertilised, the corpus luteum breaks down and stops making progesterone. The lining of the uterus then passes out through the woman's vagina during menstruation. If, however, the egg is fertilised, the corpus luteum carries on making progesterone, the lining is not shed, and menstruation doesn't happen. The first sign that tells a woman she is pregnant is when her monthly periods stop. Later on in pregnancy, the placenta secretes progesterone, taking over the role of the corpus luteum.\\n\\n## EXTENSION WORK\\n\\n'Corpus luteum' is Latin for 'yellow body'. A corpus luteum appears as a large yellow swelling in an ovary after the egg has been released.\\n\\n## CHAPTER QUESTIONS\\n\\nMore questions on human reproduction can be found at the end of Unit 2 on page 116.\\n\\n## SKILLS: CRITICAL THINKING\\n\\n1.

It covers many aspects of plant life, including nutrition (photosynthesis), movement of materials around the plant, and reproduction. There are many reasons why we need to study how plants work, not least because they provide the world's food supply and oxygen. Animals, including humans, could not exist without plants. Modern agriculture depends on the scientific study of plant physiology, as does our understanding of ecosystems.\\n---\",\n",
       "  '# 10 PLANTS AND FOOD\\n\\nThis chapter looks at photosynthesis, the process by which plants make starch, and the structure of leaves in relation to photosynthesis. It also deals with how plants obtain other nutrients, and their uses in the plant.\\n\\n## LEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n- Investigate photosynthesis by testing for the production of starch in a leaf\\n- Investigate the need for light, carbon dioxide and chlorophyll for photosynthesis\\n- Understand the process of photosynthesis and its importance in the conversion of light energy to chemical energy\\n- Know the word equation and the balanced symbol equation for photosynthesis\\n- Describe the structure of the leaf and explain how it is adapted for photosynthesis\\n- Understand how light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration and temperature affect the rate of photosynthesis\\n- Investigate photosynthesis using the evolution of oxygen from a water plant\\n- Understand that plants require mineral ions for growth, and that magnesium ions are needed to make chlorophyll and nitrate ions are needed to make amino acids\\n\\n## PLANTS MAKE STARCH\\n\\nAll the foods shown in Figure 10.1 are products of plants. Some, such as potatoes, rice and bread (made from cereals such as wheat or rye), form the staple diet of humans. They all contain starch, which is the main storage carbohydrate made by plants. Starch is a good way of storing carbohydrate because it insoluble, compact and can be broken down easily.\\n\\nFigure 10.1 All these foods are made by plants or made from products of plants. They all contain starch.\\n---\\n## ACTIVITY 1\\n\\n### PRACTICAL: TESTING LEAVES FOR STARCH\\n\\nYou can test for starch in food by adding a few drops of yellow-brown iodine solution (see Chapter 4). If the food contains starch, a blue-black colour is produced.',\n",
       "  \"Leaves that have been in sunlight also contain starch, but you can't test for it by adding iodine solution to a fresh leaf. The outer waxy surface of the leaf will not absorb the solution, and besides, the green colour of the leaf would hide the colour change. To test for starch in a leaf, the outer waxy layer needs to be removed and the leaf decolourised. This is done by placing the leaf in boiling ethanol (see Figure 10.2).\\n\\nA beaker of water is set up on a tripod and gauze and the water heated until it boils. A leaf is removed from a plant and killed by placing it in boiling water for 30 seconds (this stops all chemical reactions in the leaf).\\n\\nThe Bunsen burner is turned off (this is important because ethanol is highly flammable), the leaf is placed in a boiling tube containing ethanol, and the tube is placed in the beaker of hot water. The boiling point of ethanol (about 78°C) is lower than that of water (100°C) so the ethanol will boil for a few minutes, until the water cools down. This is long enough to remove most of the chlorophyll from the leaf.\\n\\nWhen the leaf has turned colourless or pale yellow, it is removed and washed in cold water to soften it, then spread out on a tile and covered with a few drops of iodine solution. After a few minutes, any parts of the leaf that contain starch will turn a dark blue-black colour. This only works if the plant has had plenty of light for some hours before the test.\\n\\n#### Figure 10.2 How to test a leaf for starch\\n\\n1. Remove leaf from potted plant\\n2.

       "  \"> **Safety note:** Wash your hands after handling the leaves. Take care not to splash boiling water. Do not heat the ethanol directly with any flame: instead use a beaker of hot water. Iodine solution will badly stain everything - including skin.\\n---\\nPLANT PHYSIOLOGY                                 PLANTS AND FOOD                                                           123\\n\\n## KEY POINT\\n\\nYou can 'de-starch' a plant by placing it in the dark for 2 or 3 days. The plant uses up the starch stores in its leaves. De-starched plants are used to find out the conditions needed for the plant to make more starch by photosynthesis.\\n\\nStarch is only made in the parts of plants that contain chlorophyll. You can show this by testing a leaf from a variegated plant, which has green and white areas to its leaves. The white parts of the leaf will give a negative starch test, staining yellow-brown with iodine solution. Only the green areas will stain blue-black. Figure 10.3 shows the results of a starch test on a leaf. The leaf was taken from a plant that had been under a bright light for 24 hours.\\n\\n![Figure 10.3 Testing a leaf for starch: (a) Leaf before test (b) Decolourised leaf (c) Leaf after test, stained blue-black with iodine solution.]\\n\\n## HINT\\n\\nYou might think that the results of the test on the variegated leaf prove that chlorophyll is needed for photosynthesis. But is this conclusion fully justified? The leaf could have photosynthesised in the white areas and the sugars been transported elsewhere in the plant. Similarly, the green areas may not be photosynthesising at all, but simply laying down starch from glucose made somewhere else. All it really shows is that starch is present in the green areas and not in the white areas of the leaf. We assume this is because chlorophyll is needed for photosynthesis.\",\n",
       "  \"![Figure 10.4 Demonstration that carbon dioxide is needed for photosynthesis. The soda lime absorbs carbon dioxide from the air in the bell jar. A Control experiment should be set up, using exactly the same apparatus but without the soda lime.]\\n\\nTaking away the source of light is not the only way you can prevent a plant making starch in its leaves. You can also place it in a closed container containing a chemical called soda lime (Figure 10.4). This substance absorbs carbon dioxide from the air around the plant. If the plant is kept under a bright light but with no carbon dioxide, it again won't be able to make starch.\\n\\n## WHERE DOES THE STARCH COME FROM?\\n\\nYou have now found out three important facts about starch production by leaves:\\n\\n- it uses carbon dioxide from the air\\n- it needs light\\n- it needs chlorophyll in the leaves.\\n\\nAs well as starch, there is another product of this process which is essential to the existence of most living things on the Earth – oxygen. When a plant is in the light, it makes oxygen gas. You can show this using an aquatic plant such as Elodea (Canadian pondweed). When a piece of this plant is placed in a test tube of water under a bright light, it produces a stream of small bubbles. If the bubbles are collected and their contents analysed, they are found to contain a high concentration of oxygen (Figure 10.5).\\n---\\n124 PLANT PHYSIOLOGY                         PLANTS AND FOOD\",\n",

This reduces water loss by evaporation, and acts as a barrier to the entry of disease-causing microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi.\\n\\n- The lower epidermis has many holes or pores called stomata (a single pore is a stoma). Usually the upper epidermis contains fewer or no stomata. The stomata allow carbon dioxide to diffuse into the leaf, to reach the photosynthetic tissues. They also allow oxygen and water vapour to diffuse out. Each stoma is formed as a gap between two highly specialised cells called guard cells, which can change their shape to open or close the stoma.\\n\\n- In the middle of the leaf are two layers of photosynthetic cells called the mesophyll (\"mesophyll\" just means \"middle of the leaf\"). Just below the upper epidermis is the palisade mesophyll layer. This is a tissue made of long, narrow cells, each containing hundreds of chloroplasts, and is the main site of photosynthesis. The palisade cells are close to the source of light, and the upper epidermis is relatively transparent, allowing light to pass through to the enormous numbers of chloroplasts which lie below.\\n\\n- Below the palisade layer is a tissue made of more rounded, loosely packed cells, with air spaces between them, called the spongy mesophyll layer. These cells also photosynthesise, but have fewer chloroplasts than the palisade cells. They form the main gas exchange surface of the leaf, absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen and water vapour. The air spaces allow these gases to diffuse in and out of the mesophyll.',\n",
       "  \"- Water and mineral ions are supplied to the leaf by vessels in a tissue called the xylem. This forms a continuous transport system throughout the plant. Water is absorbed by the roots and passes up through the stem and through veins in the leaves in the transpiration stream. In the leaves, the water leaves the xylem and supplies the mesophyll cells.\\n\\n- The products of photosynthesis, such as sugars, are carried away from the mesophyll cells by another transport system, the phloem. The phloem supplies all other parts of the plant, so that tissues and organs that can't make their own food receive products of photosynthesis. The veins in the leaf contain both xylem and phloem tissue, and branch again and again to supply all parts of the leaf.\\n\\nYou will find out more about both plant transport systems in Chapter 11.\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\n\\nStarch is insoluble and so cannot be transported around the plant. The phloem carries only soluble substances such as sugars (mainly sucrose) and amino acids. These are converted into other compounds when they reach their destination.\\n\\n## FACTORS AFFECTING THE RATE OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS\",\n",
       "  \"## FACTORS AFFECTING THE RATE OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS\\n\\nWhen the light intensity rises, the rate of photosynthesis begins by rising too, but eventually it reaches a maximum rate. What makes the rate 'level off' (flatten) like this? It is because some other factor needed for photosynthesis is in short supply, so that increasing the light intensity does not affect the rate any more. Normally, the factor which 'holds back' the rate of photosynthesis is the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air. This is only about 0.03 to 0.04%, and the plant can only take up the carbon dioxide and fix it into carbohydrate at a certain rate. If the plant is put in a closed container with a higher than normal concentration of carbon dioxide, it will photosynthesise at a faster rate. If there is both a high light intensity and a high level of carbon dioxide, the temperature may limit the rate of photosynthesis, by limiting the rate of the chemical reactions in the leaf. A rise in temperature will then increase the rate. With normal levels of carbon dioxide, very low temperatures (close to 0 °C) slow the reactions, but high temperatures (above about 35 °C) also reduce photosynthesis by denaturing enzymes in the plant cells (see Chapter 1).\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\n\\nA limiting factor is the component of a reaction that is in 'shortest supply' so that it prevents the rate of the reaction increasing; in other words sets a 'limit' to it.\\n---\\nPLANT PHYSIOLOGY                          PLANTS AND FOOD                                                                127\\n\\n## KEY POINT\\n\\nKnowledge of limiting factors is used in some glasshouses (greenhouses) to speed up the growth of crop plants such as tomatoes and lettuces (see Chapter 15). Extra carbon dioxide is added to the air around the plants, by using gas burners. The higher concentration of carbon dioxide, along with the high temperature in the glasshouse, increases the rate of photosynthesis and the growth of the leaves and fruits.\",\n",

This is easier to see as a graph (Figure 10.7).\\n\\n| Condition | CO2 Concentration | Temperature |\\n|-----------|-------------------|-------------|\\n| High      | 0.15% CO2         | 30°C        |\\n| Medium    | 0.15% CO2         | 20°C        |\\n| Low       | 0.03% CO2         | 20°C or 30°C|\\n\\nFigure 10.7 Light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration and temperature can all act as limiting factors on the rate of photosynthesis.\\n\\n## ACTIVITY 2\\n\\n### PRACTICAL: MEASURING THE RATE OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS USING PONDWEED\\n\\n> Safety note: Wash hands after collecting and preparing pondweed. Do not handle the lamp, plug or switch with wet hands.\\n\\nYou can measure the rate of photosynthesis of a plant by measuring how quickly it produces oxygen. With a land plant this is difficult, because the oxygen is released into the air, but with an aquatic plant such as the pondweed Elodea, bubbles of oxygen are released into the water around the plant (Figure 10.5).\\n\\nIf the bubbles formed per minute are counted, this is a measure of the rate of photosynthesis of the plant. It is easiest to count the bubbles if the cut piece of weed is placed upside down in a test tube, as shown in Figure 10.8. A small paperclip attached to the bottom of the piece of weed makes it sink.\\n\\nFigure 10.8 Measuring the rate of photosynthesis in an aquatic plant.\\n\\nThe light intensity is changed by moving the lamp, altering the distance between the lamp and the pondweed.

       "  \"# 11 TRANSPORT IN PLANTS\\n\\nChapter 10 described how plants make food by photosynthesis. Photosynthesis requires water from the roots to be transported to the leaves, and sugars and other products of photosynthesis to be transported away from the leaves to the rest of the plant. This chapter explains how these materials are moved through the plant.\\n\\n## LEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n- Understand how water can move in or out of plant cells by osmosis\\n- Investigate osmosis in living and non-living systems (plant cells and Visking tubing)\\n- Describe the role of the xylem in the transport of water and mineral ions from the roots to other parts of a plant\\n- Describe the role of phloem in the transport of sucrose and amino acids from the leaves to other parts of a plant\\n- Understand the origin of carbon dioxide and oxygen as waste products of metabolism and their loss from the stomata of a leaf\\n\\n## OSMOSIS\\n\\nOsmosis is the name of a process by which water moves into and out of cells. In order to understand how water moves through a plant, you need to understand the mechanism of osmosis. Osmosis happens when a material called a partially permeable membrane separates two solutions. One artificial partially permeable membrane is called Visking tubing. This is used in kidney dialysis machines. Visking tubing has microscopic holes in it, which let small molecules like water pass through (it is permeable to them) but is not permeable to some larger molecules, such as the sugar sucrose. This is why it is called 'partially' permeable. You can show the effects of osmosis by filling a Visking tubing 'sausage' with concentrated sucrose solution, attaching it to a capillary tube and placing the Visking tubing in a beaker of water (Figure 11.1).\",\n",

       "  \"So far we have only been dealing with osmosis through Visking tubing. However, there are partially permeable membranes in cells too. The cell surface membranes of both animal and plant cells are partially permeable, and so is the inner membrane around the plant cell's sap vacuole (Figure 11.3).\\n\\n### Figure 11.3 Membranes in animal and plant cells\\n\\n| Animal Cell | Plant Cell |\\n|-------------|------------|\\n| - Cytoplasm | - Inner membrane around sap vacuole |\\n| - Cell surface membrane | - Cell surface membrane |\\n| - Nucleus | - Cellulose cell wall |\\n|           | - Sap vacuole |\\n|           | - Cytoplasm |\\n|           | - Nucleus |\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\n\\nThe cell wall has large holes in it, making it fully permeable to water and solutes. Only the cell membranes are partially permeable barriers that allow osmosis to take place.\\n\\nAround the plant cell is the tough cellulose cell wall. This outer structure keeps the shape of the cell, and can resist changes in pressure inside the cell. This is very important, and critical in explaining the way that plants are supported. The cell contents, including the sap vacuole, contain many dissolved solutes, such as sugars and ions.\\n\\nIf a plant cell is put into pure water or a dilute solution, the contents of the cell have a lower water potential than the external solution, so the cell will absorb water by osmosis (Figure 11.4). The cell then swells up and the cytoplasm pushes against the cell wall. A plant cell that has developed an internal pressure like this is called turgid.\\n\\n### Figure 11.4 The effects of osmosis on plant cells\",\n",

The cell decreases in volume and the cytoplasm no longer pushes against the cell wall. In this state, the cell is called flaccid. Eventually the cell contents shrink so much that the membrane and cytoplasm split away from the cell wall and gaps appear between the wall and the membrane. A cell like this is called plasmolysed. You can see plasmolysis happening in the plant cells shown in Figure 11.5. The space between the cell wall and the cell surface membrane will now be filled with the sucrose solution.\\n\\nFigure 11.5 shows cells of onion epidermis, demonstrating plasmolysis. The cell membranes and cytoplasm can be seen to have pulled away from the cell wall.\\n\\n### KEY POINT',\n",
       "  \"### KEY POINT\\n\\nThis chapter only covers plant cells. Osmosis also happens in animal cells, but there is much less water movement. This is because animal cells do not have a strong cell wall around them, and can't resist the changes in internal pressure resulting from large movements of water. For example, if red blood cells are put into water, they will swell up and burst. If the same cells are put into a concentrated salt solution, they lose water by osmosis and shrink, producing cells with crinkly edges (Figure 11.6).\\n\\nFigure 11.6 compares the red blood cells on the right, which were placed in a 3% salt solution, with the normal cells on the left. Blood plasma has a concentration equal to a 0.85% salt solution.\\n\\nTurgor (the state a plant is in when its cells are turgid) is very important to plants. The pressure inside the cells pushes neighbouring cells against each other, like a box full of inflated balloons. This supports the non-woody parts of the plant, such as young stems and leaves, and holds stems upright, so the leaves can carry out photosynthesis properly. Turgor is also important in the functioning of stomata. If a plant loses too much water from its cells so that they become flaccid, this makes the plant wilt. You can see wilting in a pot plant which has been left for too long without water. The leaves droop and collapse. In fact this is a protective action. It cuts down water loss by reducing the exposed surface area of the leaves and closing the stomata.\\n\\nInside the plant, water moves from cell to cell by osmosis. If a cell has a higher water potential than the cell next to it, water will move from the first cell to the second. In turn, this will dilute the contents of the second cell, so that it has a higher water potential than the next cell. In this way, water can move across a plant tissue, down a gradient of water potential (Figure 11.7).\\n\\nFigure 11.7 illustrates how water moves from cell to cell down a water potential gradient:\",\n",

Microscopes using a mirror for daylight illumination must never be placed where direct sunlight might strike the mirror otherwise permanent retinal damage may occur.\\n\\nA drop of concentrated (1 mol per dm³) sucrose solution is placed on one microscope slide, and a drop of distilled water on a second slide. Two small squares of inner epidermis are removed from the outer fleshy layers of an onion (Figure 11.8). One square is transferred to the sucrose solution, and the second to the water. This is done as quickly as possible, so that the cells do not dry out.\\n\\n![Figure 11.8 Investigating osmosis in onion epidermis cells]\\n\\nA drop of the correct solution is added to the top of each specimen, followed by a cover slip. Any excess liquid is blotted (cleaned) up with filter paper.\\n\\nEach slide is examined through the microscope for several minutes. The specimen in water will show turgid cells, similar to the first cell in Figure 11.4. The cells in sucrose solution will gradually plasmolyse, as shown in the last diagram of Figure 11.4, and Figure 11.5.',\n",
       "  'It is interesting to replace the sugar solution on the first slide with distilled water, to see the effect on the plasmolysed cells. This can be done quite easily without removing the cover slip. Some water is placed on one side of the cover slip and drawn across the slide using filter paper, as shown in Figure 11.8. After a while all the sucrose solution is replaced by water. If the cells are now observed for a few minutes, they will gradually recover from their plasmolysed condition until they are fully turgid again.\\n\\nIt may be possible for you to carry out these procedures.

Xylem contains dead cells arranged end-to-end, forming continuous vessels. When they are mature, the vessels contain no cytoplasm. Instead, they have a hollow central space or lumen through which the water passes. The walls of the xylem vessels contain a woody material called lignin (Figure 11.10).\",\n",
       "  'The xylem vessels begin life as living cells with normal cytoplasm and cellulose cell walls. As they develop they become elongated, and gradually their original cellulose cell walls become impregnated with lignin, made by the cytoplasm. As this happens, the cells die, forming hollow tubes. Lignification makes them very strong, and enables them to carry water up tall plants without collapsing. Lignin is also impermeable to water.\\n\\nFigure 11.10 Xylem vessels in a stem. The spirals and rings (stained red) are made of lignin.\\n\\n## TRANSPORT IN THE PHLOEM\\n\\nThe other plant transport tissue, the phloem, consists of living cells at all stages in its development. Tubes in the phloem are also formed by cells arranged end-to-end, but they have cell walls made of cellulose, and retain their cytoplasm. The end of each cell is formed by a cross-wall of cellulose with holes, called a sieve plate. The living cytoplasm extends through the holes in the sieve plates, linking each cell with the next, forming a long sieve tube (Figure 11.11). The sieve tubes transport the products of photosynthesis from the leaves to other parts of the plant. Sugars for energy, or amino acids for building proteins, are carried to young leaves and other growing points in the plant. Sugar may also be taken to the roots and converted into starch for storage. Despite being living cells, the phloem sieve tubes have no nucleus. They seem to be controlled by other cells that lie alongside the sieve tubes, called companion cells (Figure 11.11).\\n\\nFigure 11.11 Xylem vessels in a stem\\n\\n| Component | Description |\\n|-----------|-------------|\\n| Sieve plate | Cross-wall of cellulose with holes |\\n| Sieve tube | Long tube formed by connected cells |\\n| Companion cell | Cell controlling sieve tube |\\n| Cell wall | Made of cellulose |\\n| Nucleus | Present in companion cell |\\n| Sieve pores | Holes in sieve plate |\\n\\n### REMINDER',\n",

The movement is brought about by rapid changes in turgor of specialised cells at the base of the leaves.\\n\\nFigure 12.1 The Venus flytrap catches and digests insects to gain extra nutrients. The plant responds very quickly to a fly landing on one of its leaves.\\n\\n## TROPISMS\\n\\nMost plants do not respond to stimuli as quickly as the Venus flytrap, because their response normally involves a change in their rate of growth. Different parts of plants may grow at different rates, and a plant may respond to a stimulus by increasing growth near the tip of its shoot or roots.\\n\\nImagine a plant growing normally in a pot. Usually, most light will be falling on the plant from above. If you turn the plant on its side and leave it for a day or so, you will see that its shoot starts to grow upwards (Figure 12.2).\",\n",
       "  \"Figure 12.2 This bean has responded to being placed horizontally. The growing shoot has started to bend upwards.\\n---\\nThere are two stimuli acting on the plant in Figure 12.2. One is the direction of the light that falls on the plant. The other stimulus is gravity. Both light and gravity are directional stimuli (they act in a particular direction). The growth response of a plant to a directional stimulus is called a **tropism**. If the growth response is towards the direction of the stimulus, it is a positive tropism, and if it is away from the direction of the stimulus, it is a negative tropism. The stem of the plant in Figure 12.2 is showing a positive **phototropism** and a negative **geotropism**, which both make the stem grow upwards.\\n\\nThe aerial part of a plant (the 'shoot') needs light to carry out photosynthesis. This means that in most species, a positive phototropism is the strongest tropic response of the shoot. If a shoot grows towards the light, it ensures that the leaves, held out at an angle to the stem, will receive the maximum amount of sunlight. This response is easily seen in any plant placed near a window, or another source of 'one-way' or unidirectional light (Figure 12.3).\\n\\nIn darkness or uniform light, the shoot shows a negative geotropism. As you might expect, the roots of plants are strongly positively geotropic. This response makes sure that the roots grow down into the soil, where they can reach water and mineral ions. Roots also fix a plant firmly in place – they provide 'anchorage'.\\n\\nThe roots of some species that have been studied are also negatively phototropic, but most roots don't respond to directional light at all. Table 12.1 summarises the main tropisms.\\n\\nTable 12.1: The main responses of plants to directional stimuli (tropisms).\",\n",
       "  \"Table 12.1: The main responses of plants to directional stimuli (tropisms).\\n\\n| Stimulus | Name of response | Response of shoots | Response of roots |\\n|----------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|\\n| light | phototropism | grow towards light source (positive phototropism) | most species show no response; some grow away from light (negative phototropism) |\\n| gravity | geotropism | grow away from direction of gravity (negative geotropism) | grow towards direction of gravity (positive geotropism) |\\n\\n## DETECTING THE LIGHT STIMULUS – PLANT HORMONES\\n\\nPlants do not have the obvious sense organs and nervous system of animals. However, since they respond to stimuli such as light and gravity, they must have some way of detecting them and coordinating the response. The detection system of phototropism was first investigated by the great English biologist Charles Darwin (see Chapter 19) in the late nineteenth century. Instead of using stems, Darwin (and later scientists) used cereal coleoptiles, which are easier to grow and use in experiments.\\n\\nA **coleoptile** is a protective sheath that covers the first leaves of a cereal seedling. It protects the delicate leaves as the shoot emerges through the soil (Figure 12.4). Coleoptiles have a simple structure and are easy to grow, so they are often used to investigate tropisms.\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\n- Phototropisms are growth responses to light from one direction. Geotropisms are growth responses to the direction of gravity ('geo' refers to the Earth).\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\n- Light from one direction is called 'unidirectional'. If light shines on the plant evenly from all directions, this is called 'uniform' light.\",\n",
       "  \"### EXTENSION WORK\\nCharles Darwin is best known for his theory of evolution by natural selection (Chapter 19). However, he carried out research in other areas of biology, including studying plant hormones. You could do some research to find out more about his life and work. Make a list of his achievements.\\n---\\nDarwin showed that the stimulus of unidirectional light was detected by the tip of the coleoptile, and transmitted to a growth zone, just behind the tip (Figure 12.5).\\n\\nFigure 12.5 Darwin's experiments with phototropism (1880)\\n\\n| Stage | Description | Result |\\n|-------|-------------|--------|\\n| (a) | coleoptile before experiment | Straight growth |\\n| (b) | intact coleoptile | Shows growth and curvature towards the light |\\n| (c) | coleoptile with tip removed | Shows no growth or bending |\\n| (d) | coleoptile with tip covered by opaque cap | Shows growth but no bending |\\n\\nThe figure shows the direction of light coming from the right side in all cases.\\n\\nSince plants don't have a nervous system, biologists began to look for a chemical messenger (or plant hormone) that might be the cause of phototropism in coleoptiles. Between 1910 and 1926 several scientists investigated this problem. Some of their results are summarised in Figure 12.6.\\n\\nExperiment 1\\n\\n| Condition | Result |\\n|-----------|--------|\\n| tip of coleoptile removed | - |\\n| tip replaced on mica sheet | no bending |\\n| tip replaced on gelatine block | normal bending towards light |\\n\\nThe figure shows the direction of light coming from the right side.\\n\\nExperiment 2\\n\\n| Condition | Result |\\n|-----------|--------|\\n| tip removed | No bending |\\n| tip replaced on one side | - |\\n| - | bending occurs without unilateral light stimulus |\\n\\nThese experiments demonstrate the role of the coleoptile tip in detecting light and initiating the bending response, as well as the potential involvement of a chemical messenger in transmitting the signal from the tip to the growth zone.\\n---\\n## Experiment 3\",\n",
       "  \"[Diagram showing three stages of an experiment with plant coleoptiles]\\n\\n1. Tip removed and placed on agar block for several hours\\n2. Tip discarded and agar block placed on one side of decapitated coleoptile\\n3. Bending occurs in absence of unidirectional light\\n\\nFigure 12.6 Experiments on coleoptiles that helped to explain the mechanism of phototropism.\\n\\nIn experiment 1, the stimulus for growth was found to pass through materials such as gelatine, which absorbs water-soluble chemicals, but not through materials such as mica (a mineral), which is impermeable to water. This made biologists think that the stimulus was a chemical that was soluble in water.\\n\\nIn experiment 2, it was shown that the phototropic response could be brought about, even without unidirectional light, by removing a coleoptile tip ('decapitating' the coleoptile) and placing the tip on one side of the decapitated stalk.\\n\\nIn experiment 3, it was found that the hormone could be collected in another water-absorbing material (a block of agar jelly). Placing the agar block on one side of the decapitated coleoptile stalk caused it to bend.\\n\\nInvestigations like experiments 2 and 3 led scientists to believe that the hormone caused bending by stimulating growth on the side of the coleoptile furthest from the light. The theory is that the hormone is produced in the tip of the shoot, and diffuses back down the shoot. If the shoot is in the dark, or if light is all around the shoot, the hormone diffuses at equal rates on each side of the shoot, so it stimulates the shoot equally on all sides. However, if the shoot is receiving light from one direction, the hormone moves away from the light as it diffuses downwards. The higher concentration of hormone on the 'dark' side of the shoot stimulates cells there to grow, making the shoot bend towards the light (Figure 12.7).\\n\\n[Diagram showing how plant hormone causes phototropism]\\n\\nFigure 12.7 How movement of a plant hormone causes phototropism.\",\n",
       "  \"Figure 12.7 How movement of a plant hormone causes phototropism.\\n\\nSince these experiments were carried out, scientists have identified the hormone responsible. It is called auxin. Several other types of plant hormone have been found. Like auxin, they all influence growth and development of plants in one way or another, so that many scientists prefer to call them plant growth substances rather than plant hormones.\\n\\n### EXTENSION WORK\\n\\n'Auxin' should really be 'auxins', since there are a number of chemicals with very similar structures making up a group of closely related plant hormones.\\n\\n### EXTENSION WORK\\n\\nAs well as auxins, there are four other main groups of plant hormones, called gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid and ethene. They control many aspects of plant growth and development, apart from tropisms. These include growth of buds, leaves and fruit, fruit ripening, seed germination, leaf fall and opening of stomata, to name just a few.\\n\\n## USING A CLINOSTAT TO SHOW TROPISMS\\n\\nA clinostat is a piece of apparatus consisting of an electric motor turning a cork disc. Germinating seeds are attached to the disc. The motor turns the disc and seeds around very slowly, so that the movement eliminates the effect of any directional stimulus that may be acting on the seeds. The clinostat can be turned through 90°, so that the disc rotates either horizontally or vertically.\\n---\\ncover   cotton wool   clinostat\\n   ↓        ↓            ↓\\n [───]   [─────]      [─────]\\n         ↑\\nbeans pinned to\\ncork disc with roots\\npointing outwards\\n\\n---\\nmica sheet\\n    |\\n    v\\na) |   <-- light      b) |   <-- light      c) |   <-- light\\n   |                     |                     |\\n\\n---\",\n",
       "  \"# 13 REPRODUCTION IN PLANTS\\n\\nPlants, like animals, can reproduce sexually and asexually. The sexual organs of a flowering plant are its flowers, which produce pollen and ovules containing the flower's gametes. This chapter looks at both types of reproduction in flowering plants.\\n\\n## LEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n- Describe the differences between sexual and asexual reproduction in plants\\n- Understand that plants can reproduce asexually by natural methods (illustrated by runners) and by artificial methods (illustrated by cuttings)\\n- Describe the structures of an insect-pollinated and a wind-pollinated flower and explain how each is adapted for pollination\\n- Understand that the growth of the pollen tube followed by fertilisation leads to seed and fruit formation\\n- Understand how germinating seeds utilise food reserves until the seedling can carry out photosynthesis\\n- Investigate the conditions needed for seed germination\\n\\n## SEXUAL AND ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION\\n\\nYou have seen how animals can reproduce sexually and asexually (Chapter 9). Plants can also carry out both types of reproduction. Table 13.1 summarises some of the differences between the two methods of reproduction.\\n\\nTable 13.1 Sexual and asexual reproduction compared.\\n\\n| Feature of the process | Sexual reproduction | Asexual reproduction |\\n|------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\\n| gametes produced | yes | no |\\n| fertilisation takes place | yes | no |\\n| genetic variation in offspring | yes | no |\\n| has survival value in: | changing environment | stable environment |\\n\\n## KEY POINT\\n\\nAs each method of asexual reproduction involves some part of the plant growing, new cells must be produced. These cells are produced by mitosis and so are all genetically identical. This means that all the offspring formed by asexual reproduction will also be genetically identical.\\n\\n## ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN PLANTS\",\n",
       "  \"## ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN PLANTS\\n\\nThere are many different methods of asexual reproduction in plants. Most involve some part of the plant growing, and then breaking away from the parent plant before developing into a new plant (Figure 13.1).\\n\\nGardeners often take advantage of the ways that plants can reproduce asexually. They use runners, bulbs and tubers to produce more plants.\\n---\\n## REPRODUCTION IN PLANTS\\n\\n### Figure 13.1 Some methods of asexual reproduction in plants\\n\\n1. Runner reproduction:\\n   - A new plant is produced where the runner touches the ground.\\n   - Shows parent plant with runner extending to form a new plant at ground level.\\n\\n2. Potato tuber reproduction:\\n   - Potato tubers form underground at the ends of branches from the main stem.\\n   - Each potato can produce several new plants from the 'eyes' which are buds.\\n\\n3. Bulb reproduction:\\n   - Some plants form bulbs. They are the bases of leaves which have become swollen with food.\\n   - Buds in them can develop into new plants.\\n   - Plants can form more than one bulb.\\n   - Image shows a bulb with a second bulb formed and roots.\\n\\nAnother type of asexual reproduction is to grow plants from cuttings. A piece of a plant's stem, with a few leaves attached, is cut from a healthy plant. This is planted in damp soil or compost, where it will grow roots and develop into a new plant (Figure 13.2).\\n\\n### Figure 13.2 These geranium cuttings have started to grow roots\\n(Image shows three small potted plants with visible roots growing)\\n\\n## SEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN PLANTS\\n\\n> **REMINDER**\\n> \\n> Haploid cells have only half the number of chromosomes of other body cells of that species.\",\n",
       "  'Plants produce specialised, haploid gametes in their flowers. The male gametes are contained within the pollen grains and the female gametes are egg cells or ova. Just as in animals, the male gametes must be transferred to the female gametes. This takes place through pollination, which is normally carried out either by wind or insects. Following pollination, fertilisation takes place and the zygote formed develops into a seed, which, in turn, becomes enclosed in a fruit.\\n\\n### PRODUCTION OF GAMETES AND POLLINATION\\n\\nThe gametes are produced by meiosis in structures in the flowers. Pollen grains are produced in the anthers of the stamens. The ova are produced in ovules in the ovaries.\\n\\nIn pollination, pollen grains are transferred from the anthers of a flower to the stigma. If this occurs within the same flower it is called self-pollination. If the pollen grains are transferred to a different flower, it is called cross-pollination. Pollination can occur by wind or by insect in either case.\\n---\\nPlants that are wind-pollinated produce flowers with a different structure to those of insect-pollinated flowers. These differences are related to the different methods of pollination of the flowers. Figure 13.3 shows the structure of a typical insect-pollinated flower and Figure 13.4 shows the structure of a typical wind-pollinated flower. Table 13.2 summarises the main differences between insect-pollinated flowers and wind-pollinated flowers.\\n\\n![Figure 13.3 The main structures in an insect-pollinated flower.]\\n\\n![Figure 13.4 The main structures in a wind-pollinated flower.]\\n\\nTable 13.2 Differences between insect-pollinated and wind-pollinated flowers.',\n",

However, for fertilisation to take place, the nucleus of the pollen grain (the male gamete) must fuse with the nucleus of the ovum, which is inside an ovule in the ovary. To transfer the nucleus to the ovum, the pollen grain forms a pollen tube, which grows down through the tissue of the style and into the ovary. Here it curves around to enter the opening in an ovule. The tip of the tube dissolves and allows the pollen grain nucleus to move out of the tube and into the ovule. Here it fertilises the ovum nucleus. These events are summarised in Figure 13.5.\\n---\\n\\n### SEED AND FRUIT FORMATION\\n\\nOnce fertilisation has occurred, a number of changes take place in the ovule and ovary that will lead to the fertilised ovule becoming a seed and the ovary in which it is found becoming a fruit. Different flowers produce different types of fruits, but in all cases the following four changes take place.\",\n",

       "  \"The living components of an ecosystem are called the biotic components. The non-living (physical) components are the abiotic components (compare these with biotic and abiotic factors, below).\\n\\nAn ecosystem contains a variety of habitats. A habitat is the place where an organism lives. For example, habitats in a pond ecosystem include the open water, the mud at the bottom of the pond, and the surface water.\\n\\nAll the organisms of a particular species found in an ecosystem at a certain time form the population of that species. All the immature frogs (tadpoles) swimming in a pond are a population of tadpoles; all the water lily plants growing in the pond make up a population of water lilies.\\n\\nThe populations of all species (animals, plants and other organisms) found in an ecosystem at a particular time form the community. Figure 14.3 illustrates the main components of a pond ecosystem.\\n\\n[A diagram of a pond ecosystem is shown, illustrating various components such as:\\n- Sunlight\\n- Air\\n- Water\\n- Soil\\n- Floating plants in an open water habitat\\n- Plankton in an open water habitat\\n- Rooted plants: habitat is partly soil, partly water and may be partly air\\n- Snails' habitat is mainly the surface of soil and plants; small organisms are grazed\\nThe diagram also indicates components of the physical environment and components of the biological community.]\\n\\n### USING QUADRATS TO SAMPLE FROM A HABITAT\",\n",
       "  \"### USING QUADRATS TO SAMPLE FROM A HABITAT\\n\\nWhen an ecologist wants to know how many organisms there are in a particular habitat, it would not be possible for him to count them all. Instead, he is forced to count a smaller representative part of the population, called a sample. Sampling of plants, or animals that do not move much (such as snails), can be done using a sampling square called a quadrat. A quadrat is usually made from metal, wood or plastic. The size of quadrat you use depends on the size of the organisms being sampled. For example, to count plants growing on a school field, you could use a quadrat with sides 0.5 or 1 metre in length (Figure 14.4).\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\n\\nDecomposers are fungi and some species of bacteria. They feed by saprotrophic nutrition (see Chapter 2)\\n\\n### HINT\\n\\nPeople often mistakenly call quadrats 'quadrants'. A quadrant is quite different – it is a quarter of a circle.\\n---\\n9 |\\n8 |\\n7 |   2,6\\n6 |\\n10 m 5 |                8,4\\n4 |\\n3 |\\n2 |\\n1 |\\n0 +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+\\n  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9\\n       <---- 10 m ---->\\n\\n---\\nA pair of random numbers is generated, using the random number function on a calculator. These numbers are used as coordinates to position the quadrat in the large square.\\n\\nThe numbers of dandelions in the quadrat are counted. The process is then repeated for nine more quadrats.\\n\\nThe tape measures are then moved to area B and the process repeated to sample from ten more quadrats in that part of the field.\\n\\nThe table below shows a set of results for a study like this.\\n\\nTable 14.1\",\n",

Do the results support the hypothesis that the population numbers are different? How could you improve the reliability of the results?\\n\\n## INTERACTIONS IN ECOSYSTEMS\\n\\nThe organisms in an ecosystem are continually interacting with each other and with their physical environment. Interactions include the following.',\n",
       "  \"- Feeding among the organisms – the plants, animals and decomposers are continually recycling the same nutrients through the ecosystem.\\n- Competition among the organisms – animals compete for food, shelter, mates, nesting sites; plants compete for carbon dioxide, mineral ions, light and water.\\n- Interactions between organisms and the environment – plants absorb mineral ions, carbon dioxide and water from the environment; plants also give off water vapour and oxygen into the environment; animals use materials from the environment to build shelters; the temperature of the environment can affect processes occurring in the organisms; processes occurring in organisms can affect the temperature of the environment (all organisms produce some heat).\\n\\n### REMINDER\\n\\nDon't forget that plants take in carbon dioxide and give out oxygen only when there is sufficient light for photosynthesis to occur efficiently. When there is little light, plants take in oxygen and give out carbon dioxide. You should be able to explain the reasons for this (see Chapter 10).\\n---\\n## BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC FACTORS\\n\\nThere are many factors that influence the numbers and distribution of organisms in an ecosystem. There are two types of factor – biotic and abiotic.\\n\\nBiotic factors are biological. Many (but not all) involve feeding relationships. They include:\\n\\n- availability of food and competition for food resources\\n- predation\\n- parasitism\\n- disease\\n- presence of pollinating insects\\n- availability of nest sites.\\n\\nAbiotic factors are physical or chemical factors. They include:\\n\\n- climate, such as light intensity, temperature and water availability\\n- hours of daylight\\n- soil conditions, such as clay content, nitrate level, particle size, water content and pH\\n- other factors specific to a particular habitat, such as salinity (salt content) in an estuary, flow rate in a river, or oxygen concentration in a lake\\n- pollution.\",\n",
       "  'Clearly which factors affect population sizes and distribution of organisms will depend on the type of ecosystem. If you take the example of a river, some of the main abiotic factors could be:\\n\\n- depth of water\\n- flow rate\\n- type of material at the bottom of the stream (stones, sand, mud etc.)\\n- concentration of minerals in the water\\n- pH\\n- oxygen concentration\\n- cloudiness of the water\\n- presence of any pollution.\\n\\nThe main biotic factors affecting animals in the river will be food supply, either from plants or other animals. But other factors are important too – large fish could not live in a shallow stream!\\n\\nIt is impossible to generalise about which factors are the most important. In a heavily polluted river all the organisms could be killed by the pollution, while in a clean river depth and flow rate might have a greater effect on the animals that could live there. The different factors may also affect one another. For example, a faster flow rate could mix the water with air, increasing the amount of dissolved oxygen.\\n\\nThe main factor affecting large ecosystems is climate, particularly temperature and rainfall. Climate is the reason why tropical rainforests are restricted to a strip near the equator of the Earth, while pine forests grow in the higher latitudes of the northern hemisphere.\\n\\n### KEY POINTS\\n\\nA predator is an animal that kills and eats another animal. A parasite is an organism (animal or plant) that lives in or on another organism (called its host) and gets its nutrition from the host. e.g. mosquitoes are parasites of humans (and other animals), and the human is the host of the mosquito.\\n\\nLarge areas of the Earth dominated by a specific type of vegetation are called biomes. Temperate grassland and tropical rain forest are two examples of biomes. You could carry out some research to find out about these and other biomes.\\n---\\n## FEEDING RELATIONSHIPS',\n",
       "  \"The simplest way of showing feeding relationships within an ecosystem is a food chain (Figure 14.6).\\n\\nIn any food chain, the arrow (→) means 'is eaten by'. In the food chain illustrated, the grass is the producer. It is a plant so it can photosynthesise and produce food materials. The grasshopper is the primary consumer. It is an animal which eats the producer and is also a herbivore. The lizard is the secondary consumer. It eats the primary consumer and is also a carnivore. The different stages in a food chain (producer, primary consumer and secondary consumer) are called trophic levels.\\n\\nMany food chains have more than three links in them. Here are two examples of longer food chains:\\n\\nfilamentous algae → mayfly nymph → caddis fly larvae → salmon\\n\\nIn this freshwater food chain, the extra link in the chain makes the salmon a tertiary consumer.\\n\\nplankton → crustacean → fish → ringed seal → polar bear\\n\\nIn this marine (sea) food chain, the fifth link makes the polar bear a quaternary consumer. Because nothing eats the polar bear, it is also called the top carnivore.\\n\\nFood chains are a convenient way of showing the feeding relationships between a few organisms in an ecosystem, but they oversimplify the situation. The marine food chain above implies that only crustaceans feed on plankton, which is not true. Some whales and other mammals also feed on plankton. For a fuller understanding, you need to consider how the different food chains in an ecosystem relate to each other. Figure 14.7 gives a clearer picture of the feeding relationships involved in a freshwater ecosystem in which salmon are the top carnivores. This is the food web of the salmon.\\n\\n![Figure 14.7 The food web of the salmon. As you can see, young salmon have a slightly different diet to mature salmon.]\",\n",

But, as farmyard manure is made from livestock faeces and indigestible fodder, it can only replace a portion of the lost nitrogen. Most farmers apply inorganic fertilisers to replace the nitrates and other mineral ions lost. While this can replace all the lost ions, it can also lead to pollution problems, which we will discuss later. Inorganic fertilisers do not improve soil structure in the way that organic fertilisers can, because they do not contain any decaying matter that is an essential part of the soil.\\n\\nAnother way to replace lost nitrates is to grow a legume crop (e.g. clover) in a field one year in four. Legumes have nitrogen-fixing bacteria in nodules on their roots. These bacteria convert nitrogen gas in the soil air to ammonium ions. Some of this is passed to the plants, which use it to make proteins. At the end of the season, the crop is ploughed back into the soil, and decomposers convert the nitrogen in the proteins to ammonia. This is then oxidised to nitrate by nitrifying bacteria and made available for next year's crop.\\n\\n## PEST CONTROL\",\n",
       "  \"## PEST CONTROL\\n\\nPests are organisms that reduce the yield of crop plants or stock animals. The 'yield' of a crop is the amount produced for sale. A pest can harm this in two ways:\\n\\n- lowering the amount by reducing growth, e.g. by damaging leaves and reducing photosynthesis\\n- affecting the appearance or quality of a crop, making it unsuitable for sale (Figure 15.6).\\n\\n> **DID YOU KNOW?**\\n> In Britain, about 30% of the potential maize crop is lost to weeds, insects and fungal diseases (Figure 15.6).\\n\\nAny type of organism – plants, animals, bacteria, fungi or protoctists, as well as viruses – can be a pest. Pests can be controlled in a number of ways. Chemicals called pesticides can be used to kill them, or their numbers can be reduced by using biological control methods.\\n\\nPesticides are named according to the type of organism they kill:\\n\\n- herbicides kill plant pests (they are weedkillers)\\n- insecticides kill insects\\n- fungicides kill fungi\\n- molluscicides kill snails and slugs.\\n\\nA farmer uses pesticides to kill particular pests and improve the yield from\\n\\n> **DID YOU KNOW?**\\n> A weed is a plant that is growing where it is not wanted.

Pests are only a problem when they are present in big enough numbers to cause economic damage – a few whiteflies in a tomato crop are not a problem; the real damage arises when there are millions of them. Whether or not a farmer uses pesticides is largely a decision based on cost. The increase in income due to higher yields must be set against the cost of the pesticides.\\n\\n## PROBLEMS WITH PESTICIDES\",\n",
       "  '## PROBLEMS WITH PESTICIDES\\n\\nOne problem with using pesticides is that a pest may develop resistance to the chemical. This happens through natural selection (see Chapter 19). It makes the existing pesticide useless, so that another must be found. Other problems are to do with the fact that pesticides can cause environmental damage. There are several reasons for this:\\n\\n- they may be slow to decompose – they are persistent in the environment\\n- they build up in the tissues of organisms – bioaccumulation\\n- they build up and become more concentrated along food chains – biomagnification\\n- they kill other insects that are harmless, as well as helpful species, such as bees.\\n\\nAn ideal pesticide should:\\n- control the pest effectively\\n- be biodegradable, so that no toxic products are left in the soil or on crops\\n- be specific, so that only the pest is killed\\n- not accumulate in organisms\\n- be safe to transport, store and apply\\n- be easy to apply.\\n\\nWe can explain these problems by looking at one well-documented example – the insecticide DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane).\\n\\nDDT was invented in 1874, and first discovered to be an insecticide in 1939. In World War II it was used with great success to kill malaria carrying mosquitoes and the lice that carried typhus. Its use increased up until the 1960s, when we began to understand its harmful effects. It was banned from general use in the USA in 1972, and worldwide in 2004. Limited use of DDT is still allowed for control of insects that transmit disease, although this is still regarded as controversial.\\n\\n### DID YOU KNOW?',\n",
       "  \"### DID YOU KNOW?\\n\\nCultivating large areas of land with a single crop (a monoculture) encourages pests. Monocultures make harvesting the crop easier. But if a pest arrives, it can easily spread through the crop. During the winter the pest can lie dormant in the soil ready to attack next year's crop. Crop rotation breaks the pest cycle. This is where a different crop is grown each year (Figure 15.7). When over-wintering pests emerge, their preferred crop is no longer there.\\n\\nFigure 15.7 A three-year crop rotation\\n\\n### DID YOU KNOW?\\n\\nDDT is a historical case, but there are problems with many modern pesticides. One recent example involves a class of insecticides called neonicotinoids (chemicals similar to nicotine). They have been linked to several serious ecological problems, including honey bee colony collapse disorder (CCD) and loss of birds due to a reduction in insect populations.\\n\\nDDT is a very effective insecticide, so why has it been banned?\\n\\n- DDT is very persistent, remaining active in the environment for many years. If DDT is sprayed onto a field, around half will still be there ten years later. To make things worse, the missing half won't have degraded to harmless products – some will have broken down to form a similar compound called DDE, which is also a potent insecticide, and some will have spread to other habitats. DDT is carried all around the world by wind, and has been identified in polar ice caps and deserts, thousands of kilometres away from where it was applied.\",\n",
       "  \"- By the 1950s, many types of insect began to appear that were resistant to DDT. These insects had developed a genetic mutation that prevented them from being killed by the insecticide. While DDT continued to be used, the resistant insects had an advantage over the non-resistant ones. Their numbers increased with every generation since they were able to survive exposure to the pesticide. They reproduced, passing on their resistance genes to their offspring. This is an example of natural selection (see Chapter 19). There are now hundreds of examples of pest species that have\\n---\\ndeveloped resistance to different insecticides.\\n\\n- DDT doesn't just kill pests. It will kill any type of insect, including harmless ones such as butterflies and useful species such as bees, as well as natural predators such as wasps, which might themselves kill the pest insects. Insecticides damage ecosystems by disrupting food chains.\\n\\n- DDT is very soluble in fats. When a herbivore feeds on plants that are contaminated with DDT, the insecticide is not broken down or excreted. Instead it becomes concentrated in the fatty tissues of the animal. This is called bioaccumulation. When a carnivore eats the herbivore this process is repeated, so that the insecticide builds up in concentration along the food chain. This is known as biomagnification (Figure 15.8). The levels at the top of the food chain may be toxic, leading to the death of the top carnivores in the chain. This can disrupt the food web of an ecosystem.\\n\\n| Organism    | DDT Concentration |\\n|-------------|-------------------|\\n| plankton    | (0.000 0003)      |\\n| crustaceans | (0.04)            |\\n| small fish  | (0.5)             |\\n| large fish  | (2.0)             |\\n| fish eagle  | (25)              |\\n\\nFigure 15.8 Biomagnification of DDT in a food chain\\n\\n## BIOLOGICAL CONTROL\",\n",
       "  'Figure 15.8 Biomagnification of DDT in a food chain\\n\\n## BIOLOGICAL CONTROL\\n\\nAnother option that may be used to control pests is biological control. Instead of using a toxic chemical, biological control uses another organism to reduce the numbers of a pest. We have already mentioned whiteflies as pests of tomatoes. One way of controlling them in large glasshouses is to introduce a parasite that will kill the whiteflies. A tiny wasp called Encarsia parasitises and kills their larvae, reducing the numbers of adult whitefly.\\n\\nA problem with biological control is that it never fully gets rid of a pest. If the control organism killed all the pests, then it too would die out, as it would have no food supply. Biological control aims to reduce pest numbers to a level where they no longer cause significant economic damage (Figure 15.9).\\n\\nThere are several methods of biological control. Some examples include:\\n\\n- introducing a natural predator – ladybirds can be used to control the populations of aphids in orange groves\\n\\n- introducing a herbivore – a moth was introduced from South America to control the prickly pear cactus that was becoming a serious weed in grazing land in Australia\\n\\n- introducing a parasite – the wasp Encarsia is used to control whitefly populations in glasshouse tomato crops\\n\\n- introducing a pathogenic (disease-causing) microorganism – the myxomatosis virus was deliberately released in Australia to control the rabbit population\\n\\n- introducing sterile males – these mate with the females but no offspring are produced from these matings, so numbers fall\\n\\n- using pheromones – these are natural chemicals produced by insects to attract a mate. They are used to attract pests (either males or females) to traps. The pests are then destroyed, reducing the reproductive potential of the population. Male-attracting pheromones are used to control aphids (greenfly) in plum crops.\\n---\\n# AIR POLLUTION\\n\\nOne definition of pollution is:',\n",

Over the last 100 years alone, the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by nearly 30%. This rise is mainly due to the increased burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and natural gas, as well as petrol and diesel in vehicle engines. It has been made worse by cutting down large areas of tropical rainforest (see later in this chapter). These extensive forests have been called 'the lungs of the Earth' because they absorb such vast quantities of carbon dioxide and produce equally large amounts of oxygen. Extensive deforestation (see below) means that less carbon dioxide is being absorbed. Figure 15.10 shows changes in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (in parts per million) from 1960 to 2010.\\n\\nFigure 15.11 Seasonal fluctuations in carbon dioxide levels\\n\\nFigure 15.11 Seasonal fluctuations in carbon dioxide levels\",\n",
       "  \"Figure 15.11 Seasonal fluctuations in carbon dioxide levels\\n\\nIn the autumn and winter, trees lose their leaves. Without leaves they cannot photosynthesise and so do not absorb carbon dioxide. They still respire, which produces carbon dioxide, so in the winter months, they give out carbon dioxide and the level in the atmosphere rises. In the spring and summer, with new leaves and brighter sunlight, the trees photosynthesise faster than they respire. As a result, they absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than they produce, so the level decreases. However, because there are fewer trees overall, it doesn't quite return to the low level of the previous summer.\\n\\nFigure 15.10 Changes in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere\\n\\nFigure 15.10 Changes in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\\n\\nThe increased levels of carbon dioxide and other gases contribute to global warming, or the enhanced greenhouse effect. It is important to understand that the 'normal' greenhouse effect occurs naturally – without it, more heat would be lost into space and the surface temperature of the Earth would be about 30 °C lower than it is today, and life as we know it would be impossible.\\n\\nCarbon dioxide is one of the 'greenhouse gases' that are present in the Earth's upper atmosphere. Other greenhouse gases include water vapour (H₂O), methane (CH₄), nitrous oxide (N₂O) and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).

       "  \"## WATER POLLUTION\\n\\nTwo major pollutants of freshwater are sewage and minerals from fertiliser.\\n\\n### POLLUTION OF WATER BY SEWAGE\\n\\nSewage is wet waste from houses, factories and farms. In developed countries where large-scale sewage treatment takes place, industrial and agricultural sewage is usually dealt with separately from household sewage. Household sewage consists of wastewater from kitchens and bathrooms and contains human urine and faeces, as well as dissolved organic and inorganic chemicals such as soaps and detergents. It is carried away in pipes called sewers, to be treated before it enters waterways such as rivers or the sea.\\n\\nIf sewage is discharged untreated into waterways, it produces two major problems:\\n\\n- Aerobic bacteria in the water polluted by the sewage use up the dissolved oxygen in the water as they break down the organic materials. This reduction in the level of oxygen kills larger animals such as freshwater insects and fish.\\n\\n- Untreated sewage contains pathogenic bacteria, which are a danger to human health.\\n---\\nECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT              HUMAN INFLUENCES ON THE ENVIRONMENT                                          187\\n\\nWhere untreated or 'raw' sewage enters a river, the level of oxygen in the water becomes very low as the aerobic bacteria and other microorganisms from the sewage decompose the organic matter. Only species that are adapted to live in low-oxygen conditions, such as anaerobic bacteria, can survive. As the water moves away from the outlet, it becomes oxygenated again as it mixes with clean water and absorbs oxygen from the air. The increase in dissolved oxygen levels allows more clean-water species to survive. Figure 15.15 shows the changes in oxygen content, numbers of clean-water animals, and numbers of polluted-water animals downstream from a sewage outlet.\",\n",

Figure 15.16 shows some of these.\\n\\n| Species | Characteristics | Pollution Level |\\n|---------|-----------------|-----------------|\\n| Bloodworm | Gills, head; actual size shown | Heavy organic pollution |\\n| Caddis-fly larva | Head, legs, case made of plant matter, sand or stones; actual size including case shown | Some organic pollution |\\n| Stone-fly nymph | Head, tails; actual size shown | Clean water |\\n\\nFigure 15.16 Some freshwater animals will only live in very clean water, while others can survive in very polluted areas.\\n\\n## EUTROPHICATION\\n\\nEutrophication comes from a Greek word, meaning 'well-fed'. It refers to a situation where large amounts of nutrients enter a body of water, such as a river, lake or even the sea. The nutrients in question are inorganic mineral ions, usually nitrates or phosphates. Pollution by these minerals can have very harmful effects on an aquatic ecosystem.\\n\\nThere are two main sources of excess minerals:\\n\\n- from untreated or treated sewage\\n- from artificial nitrate or phosphate fertilisers.\\n---\\n188 ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT | HUMAN INFLUENCES ON THE ENVIRONMENT\",\n",
       "  'Eutrophication is often caused by the use of artificial fertiliser. Streams and rivers that run through agricultural land that have been treated with fertiliser can contain high concentrations of nitrate and phosphate. This is because nitrate is very soluble in water, and is easily washed out of the soil by rain, a process known as leaching. This is less of a problem with phosphate fertiliser, but phosphate is also washed into waterways by surface run-off of water.\\n\\nThe excess mineral ions stimulate the growth of all plants in the river or lake, but this is usually seen first as a rapid growth of algae, called an algal bloom. The algae can increase in numbers so rapidly that they form a thick scum on the surface of the water (Figure 15.17).\\n\\nFigure 15.17 An algal bloom caused by fertiliser\\n\\nThe algae soon start to die, and are decomposed by aerobic bacteria in the water. Because the bacteria respire aerobically, they use up the oxygen in the water. In addition, the algae block the light from reaching other rooted plants, further decreasing the oxygen produced by photosynthesis. The low oxygen levels can result in fish and other aerobic animals dying. In severe cases, the water becomes anoxic (containing very little oxygen) and smelly from gases like hydrogen sulfide and methane from the bacteria. By this stage only anaerobic bacteria can survive.\\n\\nRapid eutrophication is less likely when farmers use organic fertiliser (manure). The organic nitrogen-containing compounds in manure are less soluble and so are leached less quickly from the soil.\\n\\nREMINDER\\n\\nThe sequence of events following eutrophication is:\\n- increase in mineral ions\\n- algal bloom\\n- death of algae\\n- decomposition by aerobic bacteria\\n- bacteria use up oxygen\\n- fish and other animals die\\n---\\nECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT           HUMAN INFLUENCES ON THE ENVIRONMENT                                    189\\n\\n## CHAPTER QUESTIONS',\n",

DNA consists of two strands looking like a twisted ladder - the famous 'double helix'. The 'sides' of the ladder are made of alternating sugar and phosphate groups. The 'rungs' of the ladder are made of pairs of nitrogen-containing groups called bases (Figure 16.2). There are four bases called adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine. The base adenine always pairs with thymine, and cytosine with guanine. These are called complementary base pairs. DNA is usually found in the nucleus of a cell, in the chromosomes (Figure 16.1).\\n\\nA small section of DNA that determines a particular feature is called a gene. Genes determine features by instructing cells to produce particular proteins which then lead to the development of the feature. So a gene can also be described as a section of DNA that codes for a particular protein.\\n\\nDNA can replicate (make an exact copy of) itself. When a cell divides by mitosis (see Chapter 17), each new cell receives exactly the same type and amount of DNA. The cells formed are genetically identical.\",\n",
       "  '---\\n## THE STRUCTURE OF CHROMOSOMES\\n\\nEach chromosome contains one double-stranded DNA molecule. The DNA is folded and coiled so that it can be packed into a small space.

Another chromosome will contain a different DNA molecule, and so will contain different genes.\\n\\n## HOW MANY CHROMOSOMES?\\n\\nNearly all human cells contain 46 chromosomes.

       "  '# CELL DIVISION\\n\\nGrowth and reproduction are two characteristics of living things. Both involve cell division, which is the subject of this chapter.\\n\\n## LEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n- Understand how division of a diploid cell by mitosis produces two cells that contain identical sets of chromosomes\\n- Understand that mitosis occurs during growth, repair, cloning and asexual reproduction\\n- Understand how division of a cell by meiosis produces four cells, each with half the number of chromosomes, and that this results in the formation of genetically different haploid gametes\\n- Understand how random fertilisation produces genetic variation of offspring\\n- Understand that variation within a species can be genetic, environmental or a combination of both\\n\\nIn most parts of the body, cells need to divide so that organisms can grow and replace worn out or damaged cells. The cells that are produced in this type of cell division should be exactly the same as the cells they are replacing. This is the most common form of cell division.\\n\\nOnly in the sex organs is cell division different. Here, some cells divide to produce gametes (sex cells), which contain only half the original number of chromosomes. This is so that when male and female gametes fuse together (fertilisation) the resulting cell (called a zygote) will contain the full set of chromosomes and can then divide and grow into a new individual.\\n\\nHuman body cells are diploid – they have 46 chromosomes in 23 homologous pairs. The gametes, with 23 chromosomes (one copy of each homologous chromosome), are haploid cells.\\n\\nThere are two kind of cell division: mitosis and meiosis. When cells divide by mitosis, two cells are formed. These have the same number and type of chromosomes as the original cell. Mitosis forms all the cells in our bodies except the gametes.\\n\\n> **KEY POINT**\\n> \\n> Meiosis is sometimes called a reduction division. This is because it produces cells with only half the number of chromosomes of the original cell.',\n",

Meiosis forms gametes.\\n\\n## MITOSIS\\n\\nWhen a 'parent' cell divides it produces 'daughter' cells. Mitosis produces two daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell – both daughter cells have the same number and type of chromosomes as the parent cell.\\n\\nTo achieve this, the dividing cell must do two things.\\n\\n- It must copy each chromosome before it divides. This involves the DNA replicating and more proteins being added to the structure. Each daughter cell will then be able to receive a copy of each chromosome (and each molecule of DNA) when the cell divides.\\n---\\n# VARIATION AND SELECTION\\n\\n## CELL DIVISION\\n\\nIt must divide in such a way that each daughter cell receives one copy of every chromosome.

The chromatids separate to become the chromosomes of the two daughter cells.\\n\\n(c) telophase\\n\\nIn the last stage (telophase) two new nuclei form at the poles of the cell. The cytoplasm starts to divide to produce two daughter cells. Both daughter cells have a copy of each chromosome from the parent cell.\",\n",
       "  '▲ Figure 17.1 The stages of mitosis. For simplicity the cell shown contains two homologous pairs of chromosomes (one long pair, one short). (You do not need to remember the names of the stages.)\\n\\nA number of distinct stages occur when a cell divides by mitosis. These are shown in Figure 17.1. Figure 17.2 is a photograph of some cells from the root tip of an onion. Cells in this region of the root divide by mitosis to allow growth of the root.\\n\\n▲ Figure 17.2 Cells in the root tip of an onion dividing by mitosis. Can you identify any of the stages shown in Figure 17.1?\\n---\\n## CELL DIVISION\\n\\nEach daughter cell formed by mitosis receives a copy of every chromosome, and therefore every gene, from the parent cell. Each daughter cell is genetically identical to the others. All the cells in our body (except the gametes) are formed by mitosis from the zygote (single cell formed at fertilisation). They all, therefore, contain copies of all the chromosomes and genes of that zygote. They are all genetically identical.\\n\\nWhenever cells need to be replaced in our bodies, cells divide by mitosis to make them. This happens more frequently in some regions than in others.\\n\\n- The skin loses thousands of cells every time we touch something. This adds up to millions every day that need replacing. A layer of cells beneath the surface is constantly dividing to produce replacements.\\n- Cells are scraped off the lining of the gut as food passes along. Again, a layer of cells beneath the gut lining is constantly dividing to produce replacement cells.\\n- Cells in our spleen destroy worn out red blood cells at the rate of 100 000 000 000 per day! These are replaced by cells in the bone marrow dividing by mitosis. In addition, the bone marrow forms all our new white blood cells and platelets.\\n- Cancer cells also divide by mitosis. The cells formed are exact copies of the parent cell, including the mutation in the genes that makes the cells divide uncontrollably.\\n\\n## MEIOSIS',\n",

Each daughter cell is genetically different from the other three and from the parent cell.\\n\\nDuring meiosis the parent cell must do two things:\\n- It must copy each chromosome so that there is enough genetic material to be shared between the four daughter cells\\n- It must divide twice, in such a way that each daughter cell receives just one chromosome from each homologous pair.\\n\\nThese processes are summarised in Figure 17.4.

The offspring from sexual reproduction vary genetically for a number of reasons. One reason is because of the huge variation in the gametes. Another reason is because of the random way in which fertilisation takes place. In humans, any one of the billions of sperm formed by a male during his life could, potentially, fertilise any one of the thousands of ova formed by a female.',\n",
       "  \"This variation applies to both male and female gametes. So, just using our 'low' estimate of about 8.5 million different types of human gametes means that there can be 8.5 million different types of sperm and 8.5 million different types of ova. When fertilisation takes place, any sperm could fertilise any ovum. The number of possible combinations of chromosomes (and genes) in the zygote is 8.5 million × 8.5 million = 7.2 × 10¹³, or 72 trillion! And remember, this is using our 'low' number!\\n\\nThis means that every individual is likely to be genetically unique. The only exceptions are identical twins. Identical twins are formed from the same zygote – they are sometimes called monozygotic twins. When the zygote divides by mitosis, the two genetically identical cells formed do not 'stay together'. Instead, they separate and each cell behaves as though it were an individual zygote, dividing and developing into an embryo (Figure 17.6). Because they have developed from genetically identical cells (and, originally, from the same\\n\\n▲ Figure 17.6 How identical twins are formed\\n\\n[Diagram showing zygote division and embryo formation for identical twins]\\n---\\n# VARIATION AND SELECTION\\n\\n## CELL DIVISION\\n\\nzygote), the embryos (and, later, the children and the adults they become) will be genetically identical.\\n\\nNon-identical twins develop from different zygotes and so are not genetically identical.\\n\\nSeeds are made by sexual reproduction in plants. Each seed contains an embryo, which results from a pollen grain nucleus fusing with an egg cell nucleus. Embryos from the same plant will vary genetically because they are formed by different pollen grains fertilising different egg cells and so contain different combinations of genes.\\n\\n## ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION AND CLONING\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\nCloning is a process that produces a group of genetically identical offspring (a clone) from part of the parent organism. Gametes are not involved.\",\n",
       "  \"Plant breeders have known for a long time that sexual reproduction produces variation. They realised that if a plant had some desirable feature, the best way to get more of that plant was not to collect and plant its seeds, but to clone it in some way. Modern plant-breeding techniques allow the production of many thousands of identical plants from just a few cells of the original (see Chapter 19).\\n\\nWhen organisms reproduce asexually, there is no fusion of gametes. A part of the organism grows and somehow breaks away from the parent organism. The cells it contains were formed by mitosis, so contain exactly the same genes as the parent. Asexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically identical to the parent, and genetically identical to each other.\\n\\nAsexual reproduction is common in plants (see Chapter 13). For example, flower bulbs grow and divide asexually each season to produce more bulbs. Asexual reproduction also occurs in some animals (see Chapter 9).\\n\\n## GENES AND ENVIRONMENT BOTH PRODUCE VARIATION\\n\\n### DID YOU KNOW?\\nShort pea plants are called 'dwarf' varieties. The genetics controlling the height of pea plants is described in Chapter 18.\\n\\nThere are two varieties of pea plants that are either tall or short. This difference in height is due to the genes they inherit. There are no 'intermediate height' pea plants. However, all the tall pea plants are not exactly the same height and neither are all the short pea plants exactly the same height. Figure 17.7 illustrates the variation in height of pea plants.\\n\\n| Characteristic | Left Distribution | Right Distribution |\\n|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|\\n| Type of variation | Genetic | Genetic |\\n| Environmental influence | Variation due to environment | Variation due to environment |\\n| Distribution shape | Bell curve (normal distribution) | Bell curve (normal distribution) |\\n| Peak height | Higher | Lower |\\n| Spread | Narrower | Wider |\",\n",
       "  \"Figure 17.7 Bar chart showing variation in height of pea plants.\\n---\\n208 VARIATION AND SELECTION                 CELL DIVISION\\n\\nSeveral environmental factors can influence the height of the plants.\\n\\n- They may not all receive the same amount of light and so some will not photosynthesise as well as others.\\n- They may not all receive the same amount of water and mineral ions from the soil – this could affect the manufacture of a range of substances in the plant.\\n- They may not all receive the same amount of carbon dioxide. Again, some plants will not photosynthesise as well as others.\\n\\nSimilar principles apply in humans. Identical twins have the same genes, and often grow up to look very alike (although not quite identical). Also, they often develop similar talents. However, identical twins never look exactly the same. This is especially true if, for some reason, they grow up apart. The different environments affect their physical, social and intellectual development in different ways.\\n\\n## CHAPTER QUESTIONS\\n\\nMore questions on cell division can be found at the end of Unit 5 on page 234.\\n\\n### SKILLS CRITICAL THINKING\\n\\n1.

The rules of inheritance are now known as 'Mendelian genetics' in his honour.\\n\\n## GREGOR MENDEL\\n\\nGregor Mendel was a monk who lived in a monastery in Brno in what is now the Czech Republic (Figure 18.1). He became interested in the science of heredity, and carried out hundreds of breeding experiments using pea plants. From his research Mendel was able to explain the laws governing inheritance.\\n\\nMendel found that for every feature or 'character' he investigated:\\n\\n- a 'heritable unit' (what we now call a gene) is passed from one generation to the next\\n- the heritable unit (gene) can have alternative forms (we now call these different forms alleles)\\n- each individual must have two alternative forms (alleles) per feature\\n- the gametes only have one of the alternative forms (allele) per feature\\n- one allele can be dominant over the other.\",\n",
       "  \"Mendel used these ideas to predict outcomes of cross-breeding or 'crosses' between plants, which he tested in his breeding experiments. He published his results and ideas in 1865 but few people took any notice, and his work went unrecognised for many years. It wasn't until 1900 that other biologists working on inheritance rediscovered Mendel's work and realised its importance. In 1903, the connection between the behaviour of genes in Mendelian genetics and the behaviour of chromosomes in meiosis was noticed and the science of genetics was established.\\n---\\n## VARIATION AND SELECTION\\n\\n### MENDEL'S EXPERIMENTS ON INHERITANCE\\n\\nMendel noticed that many of the features of pea plants had two alternative forms. For example, plants were either tall or very short (called a 'dwarf' variety); they either had purple or white flowers; they produced yellow seeds or green seeds. There were no intermediate forms, no pale purple flowers or green/yellow seeds or intermediate height plants. Figure 18.2 shows some of the contrasting features of pea plants that Mendel used in his breeding experiments.\\n\\n| Feature      | Option 1 | Option 2   |\\n|--------------|----------|------------|\\n| seed shape   | round    | wrinkled   |\\n| seed colour  | yellow   | green      |\\n| flower colour| purple   | white      |\\n| pod shape    | inflated | constricted|\\n| pod colour   | green    | yellow     |\\n| stem length  | tall     | dwarf      |\\n\\nFigure 18.2 Some features of pea plants used by Mendel in his breeding experiments.\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\n\\nIn his breeding experiments, Mendel initially used only plants that had 'bred true' for several generations. For example, any tall pea plants he used came from generations of pea plants that had all been tall.\",\n",
       "  \"Mendel decided to investigate, systematically, the results of cross breeding plants that had contrasting features. These were the 'parent plants', referred to as 'P' in genetic diagrams. He transferred pollen from one experimental plant to another. He also made sure that the plants could not be self-fertilised.\\n\\nHe collected all the seeds formed, grew them and noted the features that each plant developed. These plants were the first generation of offspring, called the F₁ generation. He did not cross-pollinate these plants, but allowed them to self-fertilise. Again, he collected the seeds, grew them and noted the features that each plant developed. These plants formed the second generation of offspring or F₂ generation. When Mendel used pure-breeding tall and pure-breeding dwarf plants as his parents, he obtained the results shown in Figure 18.3.\\n---\\n# VARIATION AND SELECTION GENES AND INHERITANCE 213\\n\\nP\\n\\ntall parent dwarf parent\\n\\n↓\\n\\nF₁\\n\\nall tall plants\\n\\n↓\\n\\nF₂\\n\\ntall plant tall plant tall plant dwarf plant\\n\\n3 tall : 1 dwarf\\n\\n▲ Figure 18.3 A summary of Mendel's results from breeding tall pea plants with dwarf pea plants.\\n\\nMendel obtained similar results when he carried out breeding experiments using plants with other pairs of contrasting characters (Figure 18.4). He noticed two things in particular.\\n\\n■ All the plants of the F₁ generation were of one type. This type was not a blend of the two parental features, but one or the other. For example, when tall and dwarf parents were crossed, all the F₁ plants were tall.\\n\\n■ There was always a 3:1 ratio of types in the F₂ generation. Three-quarters of the plants in the F₂ generation were of the type that appeared in the F₁ generation. One-quarter showed the other parental feature. For example, when tall F₁ plants were crossed, three-quarters of the F₂ plants were tall and one-quarter were dwarf.\",\n",
       "  \"Mendel was able to use his findings to work out how features were inherited, despite having no knowledge of chromosomes, genes or meiosis. Nowadays we can use our understanding of these ideas to explain Mendel's results.\\n---\\n## VARIATION AND SELECTION\\n\\n### EXPLAINING MENDEL'S RESULTS\\n\\n- Each feature is controlled by a gene, which is found on a chromosome.\\n- There are two copies of each chromosome and each gene in all body cells, except the gametes.\\n- The gametes have only one copy of each chromosome and each gene (i.e. one allele).\\n- There are two alleles of each gene.\\n- One allele is dominant over the other allele, which is recessive.\\n- When two different alleles (one dominant and one recessive) are in the same cell, only the dominant allele is expressed (shown in the appearance of the organism).\\n- An individual can have two dominant alleles, two recessive alleles or a dominant allele and a recessive allele in each cell.\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\n\\nNormally, we use the first letter of the dominant feature to represent the gene, with a capital letter indicating the dominant allele and a lower case letter the recessive allele. Tall is dominant to dwarf in pea plants, so we use T for the allele for tall and t for dwarf.\\n\\nWe can use the cross between tall and dwarf pea plants as an example (Figure 18.4). In pea plants, there are tall and dwarf alleles of the gene for height. We will use the symbol T for the tall allele and t for the dwarf allele. The term genotype describes the alleles each cell has for a certain feature (e.g. TT). The phenotype is the feature that results from the genotype (e.g. a tall plant).\\n\\n| phenotype of parents | tall | dwarf |\\n|----------------------|------|-------|\\n| genotype of parents  | TT   | tt    |\\n\\nBoth parents are pure breeding. The tall parent has two alleles for tallness in each cell. The dwarf parent has two alleles for dwarfness in each cell. Because each has two copies of just one allele, we say that they are homozygous for the height gene.\",\n",
       "  \"### KEY POINT\\n\\nIt is the accepted practice in genetics diagrams to show the gene present in a gamete as a letter in a circle.\\n\\n| gametes (sex cells) | T | t |\\n|---------------------|---|---|\\n\\nThe sex cells are formed by meiosis. As a result, they only have one allele each.\\n\\ngenotype of F₁: Tt\\n\\nphenotype of F₁: all tall\\n\\nThe F₁ plants have one tall allele and one dwarf allele. We say that they are heterozygous for the height gene.

It allows you to work out the results from a genetic cross. Write the genotypes of one set of sex cells across the top of the square and those of the other sex cells down the side. Then combine the alleles in the two sets of gametes; the squares represent the possible fertilisations.\\n\\n1 TT : 2 Tt : 1 tt\\n\\nYou can now work out the ratio of the different genotypes.\\n\\nphenotypes of F₂: 3 tall : 1 dwarf\\n\\nFigure 18.4 Results of crosses using true-breeding tall and dwarf pea plants.\\n---\\n# VARIATION AND SELECTION\\n\\n## GENES AND INHERITANCE\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\n\\nMendel's experiments described above, all involve single genes (e.g. the gene for height, or the gene for flower colour). The name given for inheritance involving one gene is monohybrid inheritance. It is possible to draw genetic diagrams involving two or more genes (e.g height and flower colour together), but for International GCSE you only need to interpret monohybrid crosses.\",\n",
       "  \"It is important to remember that in genetic crosses, ratios such as 3:1 are predicted ratios. In breeding experiments the actual numbers of offspring are unlikely to exactly fit a 3:1 ratio.\\n\\nImagine you flip a coin 20 times. The most likely outcome is that you will get 10 heads and 10 tails. However, you wouldn't be surprised to get, by chance, 11 heads and 9 tails, or 8 heads and 12 tails. The same principle applies to the outcome of a breeding experiment.\\n\\nFor example, one of Mendel's experiments produced 787 tall plants and 277 dwarf plants. This is a ratio of 2.84:1, not quite the expected 3:1. The reason for this is that there are a number of factors that affect survival of the plants – some pollen may not fertilise some ova, some seedlings may die before they mature, and so on. These are unpredictable or 'chance' events. The numbers that Mendel found were statistically close enough to the expected 3:1 ratio, and he found the same thing when he repeated his experiments with other characteristics.\\n\\n## WORKING OUT GENOTYPES – THE TEST CROSS\\n\\nYou cannot tell just by looking at a tall pea plant whether it is homozygous (TT) or heterozygous (Tt). Both these genotypes would appear equally tall because the tall allele is dominant.\\n\\nIt would help if you knew the genotypes of its parents. You could then write out a genetic cross and perhaps work out the genotype of your tall plant.

       "  \"- the normal alleles in 4 and 6 can only have come from their parents (1 and 2), so 1 and 2 must both carry normal alleles\\n- 1 and 2 show polydactyly, so they must have polydactyly alleles as well\\n- if they have both polydactyly alleles and normal alleles but show polydactyly, the polydactyly allele must be the dominant allele.\\n\\nNow that we know which allele is dominant, we can work out most of the genotypes in the pedigree. All the people with the normal number of digits must have the genotype dd (if they had even one D allele, they would show polydactyly). All the people with polydactyly must have at least one polydactyly allele (they must be either DD or Dd).\\n\\nFrom here, we can begin to work out the genotypes of the people with polydactyly. To do this we need to remember that people with the normal number of digits must inherit one 'normal-number' allele from each parent, and also that people with the normal number of digits will pass on one 'normal-number' allele to each of their children.\\n\\nFrom this we can say that any person with polydactyly who has children with the normal number of digits must be heterozygous (the child must have inherited one of their two 'normal-number' alleles from this parent), and also that any person with polydactyly who has one parent with the normal number of digits must also be heterozygous (the 'normal-number' parent can only have passed on a 'normal-number' allele). Individuals 1, 2, 3, 16, 17 and 18 fall into one or other of these categories and must be heterozygous.\\n\\nWe can now add this genetic information to the pedigree. This is shown in Figure 18.7.\\n\\n[A pedigree diagram is shown with the following structure and genotypes:\\n\\n- Top level: Dd (1) - Dd (2)\\n- Second level: Dd (3) - dd (4) | D (5) - dd (6) | dd (7)\\n- Third level: D (8) - dd (9) | dd (10) | dd (11) | D (12) - dd (13) | dd (14) | dd (15)\\n- Fourth level: Dd (16) | Dd (17) | Dd (18) | dd (19) | dd (20)\",\n",

It is determined by the X and Y chromosomes – the sex chromosomes. As well as the 44 non-sex chromosomes, there are two X chromosomes in all cells of females (except the egg cells) and one X and one Y chromosome in all cells of males (except the sperm). Our sex is effectively determined by the presence or absence of the Y chromosome. The full chromosome complement of male and female is shown in Figure 16.4 on page 198.\\n\\nThe inheritance of sex follows the pattern shown in Figure 18.9. In any one family, however, this ratio may well not be met. Predicted genetic ratios are usually only met when large numbers are involved. The overall ratio of male and female births in all countries is 1 : 1.\\n\\n| phenotypes of parents | male | female |\\n|------------------------|------|--------|\\n| genotypes of parents   | XY   | XX     |\\n| gametes                | X and Y | X    |\\n\\nfemale gametes: X',\n",

This is incorrect: dominant and recessive are terms that are only applied to individual alleles.\\n\\n## POLYGENIC INHERITANCE\\n\\nAll of the genetic crosses that you have seen in this chapter have been examples of inheritance involving single genes. The reason for this is that it is easier to draw genetics diagrams and explain what is happening if we start by considering alleles of a single gene. However, many characteristics are controlled by two or more genes working together. This is called polygenic inheritance.\\n\\nA good example is human skin colour. Darker skins contain greater amounts of a black pigment called melanin. This is controlled by several genes, which act together to determine the amount of melanin in the skin. Each gene has alleles that promote melanin production and alleles which do not. This produces a wide range of phenotypes (Figure 18.10).\\n\\n### DID YOU KNOW?\\n\\nMelanin protects the skin against the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation, which is a mutagen that can cause skin cancer.\\n\\nFigure 18.10 Skin colour depends on the amount of melanin in the skin. It is a result of polygenic inheritance.\\n\\nOther human characteristics determined by several genes (polygenes) are human height and body mass (weight).\\n---\\nVARIATION AND SELECTION | GENES AND INHERITANCE | 219\\n\\n## CHAPTER QUESTIONS\\n\\nMore questions on chromosomes, genes and inheritance can be found at the end of Unit 5 on page 234.\\n\\n### SKILLS | CRITICAL THINKING\",\n",

       "  \"# NATURAL SELECTION, EVOLUTION AND SELECTIVE BREEDING\\n\\nOver millions of years, life on this planet has evolved from its simple beginnings into the vast range of organisms present today. This has happened by a process called natural selection. This chapter looks at natural selection, as well as traditional methods of selective breeding and modern developments involving cloned organisms.\\n\\n## LEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n- Explain Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection\\n- Understand how resistance to antibiotics can increase in bacterial populations\\n- Understand how selective breeding can be used to produce plants with desired characteristics\\n- Understand how selective breeding can be used to produce animals with desirable characteristics\\n\\nThe meaning of 'evolution' is that species of animals and plants are not fixed in their form, but change over time. It is not a new idea. For thousands of years philosophers have discussed this theory. By the beginning of the nineteenth century there was overwhelming evidence for evolution, and many scientists had accepted that it had taken place. What was missing was an understanding of the mechanism by which evolution could have occurred.\\n\\nThe person who proposed the mechanism for evolution that is widely accepted today was the English biologist Charles Darwin (Figure 19.1). He called the mechanism natural selection.\\n\\n## THE WORK OF CHARLES DARWIN\\n\\nCharles Darwin was the son of a country doctor. He did not do particularly well at school or university and was unable to decide on a profession. His father is supposed to have said: 'you're good for nothing but shooting guns and rat-catching ... you'll be a disgrace to yourself and all of your family'. He was wrong – Darwin went on to become one of the most famous scientists of all time!\\n\\nAt the age of 22, Charles Darwin became the unpaid biologist aboard the survey ship HMS Beagle, which left England for a five-year voyage in 1831 (Figure 19.2).\",\n",

Fossils are formed when minerals replace the materials in bone and tissue, creating a replica of the original organism in the rock.\",\n",
       "  \"During the voyage, Darwin collected hundreds of specimens and made many observations about the variety of organisms and the ways in which they were adapted to their environments. He gained much information, in particular, from the variety of life forms in South America and the Galapagos Islands. Darwin was influenced by the work of Charles Lyell who was, at the time, laying the foundations of modern geology. Lyell was using the evidence of rock layers to suggest that the surface of the Earth was constantly changing. The layers of sediments in rocks represented different time periods. Darwin noticed that the fossils found in successive layers of rocks often changed slightly through the layers. He suggested that life forms were continually changing – evolving.\\n\\nOn his return to England, Darwin began to evaluate his data and wrote several essays, introducing the ideas of natural selection. He arrived at his theory of natural selection from observations made during his voyage on HMS Beagle and from deductions made from those observations. Darwin's observations were that:\\n\\n- organisms generally produce more offspring than are needed to replace them – a single female salmon can release 5 million eggs per year; a giant puffball fungus produces 40 million spores\\n- despite this over-reproduction, stable, established populations of organisms generally remain the same size – the seas are not overflowing with salmon, and we are not surrounded by lots of giant puffball fungi!\\n- members of the same species are not identical – they show variation.\\n\\nHe made two important deductions from these observations.\",\n",
       "  \"He made two important deductions from these observations.\\n\\n- From the first two observations he deduced that there is a 'struggle for existence'. Many offspring are produced, yet the population stays the same size. There must be competition for resources and many individuals must die.\\n- From the third observation he deduced that, if some offspring survive while others die, those organisms best suited to their environment would survive to reproduce. Those less suited will die. This gave rise to the phrase 'survival of the fittest'.\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\n\\nThe phrase 'survival of the fittest' does not mean physical fitness, but biological fitness. This depends on how well adapted an organism is to its environment so that it is successful in reproducing. A good way of putting it is; 'survival of the individuals that will leave most offspring in later generations'.\\n\\nNotice a key phrase in the second deduction – the best-suited organisms survive to reproduce. This means that those characteristics that give the organism a better chance of surviving will be passed on to the next generation. Fewer of the individuals that are less suited to the environment survive to reproduce. The next generation will have more of the type that is better adapted and fewer of the less well adapted type. This will be repeated in each generation.\\n\\nAnother naturalist, Alfred Russell Wallace, had also studied life forms in South America and Indonesia and had reached the same conclusions as Darwin. Darwin and Wallace published a scientific paper on natural selection jointly, although it was Darwin who went on to develop the ideas further. In 1859, he published his now famous book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (usually shortened to The Origin of Species).\",\n",
       "  \"This book changed forever the way in which biologists think about how species originate. Darwin went on to suggest that humans could have evolved from ape-like ancestors. For this he was ridiculed, largely by people who had misunderstood his ideas (Figure 19.3). He also carried out considerable research in other areas of biology, such as plant tropisms (see Chapter 12).\\n\\nFigure 19.3 Darwin's ideas were unpopular and many newspapers of the time made fun of them.\\n---\\n## VARIATION AND SELECTION\\n\\n### NATURAL SELECTION, EVOLUTION AND SELECTIVE BREEDING\\n\\n#### KEY POINT\\n\\nWhen Darwin proposed his theory of natural selection, he did not know about genes and how they control characteristics. Gregor Mendel had yet to publish his work on inheritance, and as you have seen, the significance of Mendel's work was not recognised until 1903.\\n\\nThe theory of natural selection proposes that some factor in the environment 'selects' which forms of a species will survive to reproduce. Forms that are not well adapted will not survive.\\n\\nThe following is a summary of how we think natural selection works:\\n\\n1. there is variation within the species\\n2. changing conditions in the environment (called a selection pressure) favours one particular form of the species (which has a selective advantage)\\n3. the frequency of the favoured form increases (it is selected for) under these conditions (survival of the fittest)\\n4. the frequency of the less well adapted form decreases under these conditions (it is selected against).\\n\\nAs you have seen, many gene mutations are harmful, and cells that carry them will not usually survive. Some mutations are 'neutral' and if they arise in the gametes, may be passed on without affecting the survival of the offspring. However, a few mutations can actually be beneficial to an organism. Beneficial mutations are the 'raw material' that are ultimately the source of new inherited variation.\\n\\n### SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW NATURAL SELECTION MIGHT HAVE WORKED\\n\\n#### THE HOVERFLY\",\n",
       "  \"### SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW NATURAL SELECTION MIGHT HAVE WORKED\\n\\n#### THE HOVERFLY\\n\\nFigure 19.4 shows two species of insect: a wasp and a hoverfly. Wasps can defend themselves against predators using a sting. They also have a body with yellow and black stripes. This is called a 'warning colouration'. Predators such as birds soon learn that these colours mean that wasps have the sting, and they avoid attacking them.\\n\\nHoverflies do not have a sting. However, they have an appearance that is very like a wasp, with similar yellow and black stripes – they are 'mimics' of wasps. Predators treat hoverflies as if they do have a sting.\\n\\nClearly, mimicking a wasp is an advantage to the hoverfly. How could they have evolved this appearance? We can explain how it could have happened by natural selection.\\n\\nThe selection pressure was predation by birds and other animals. Among the ancestors of present-day hoverflies there would have been variation in colours. As a result of mutations, some hoverflies gained genes that produced stripes on their bodies. These insects were less likely to be eaten by predators than hoverflies without the stripes – they had a selective advantage.\\n\\nSince the hoverflies with stripes were more likely to survive being eaten, they were more likely to reproduce, and would pass on the genes for stripes to their offspring. This process continued over many generations. Gradually more mutations and selection for 'better' stripes took place, until the hoverflies evolved the excellent warning colouration that they have today.\\n\\n#### KEY POINT\\n\\nNote that perfect stripes didn't have to appear straight away. Even a slight stripy appearance could give a small selective advantage over hoverflies without stripes. This would be enough to result in an increase in stripy hoverflies in the next generation.\\n---\\n# VARIATION AND SELECTION\\n\\n## NATURAL SELECTION, EVOLUTION AND SELECTIVE BREEDING\\n\\n### THE POLAR BEAR\",\n",
       "  \"## NATURAL SELECTION, EVOLUTION AND SELECTIVE BREEDING\\n\\n### THE POLAR BEAR\\n\\nThe polar bear lives in the Arctic, inhabiting landmasses and sea ice covering the waters within the Arctic Circle (Figure 19.5). It is a large predatory carnivore, mainly hunting seals. One way the bear hunts is to wait near holes in the ice where seals come up to breathe. It also silently approaches and attacks seals that are resting on the ice.\\n\\nPolar bears have many adaptations that suit them to their habitat. These include:\\n\\n- a thick layer of white fur, which reduces heat loss and acts as camouflage in the snow\\n- wide, large paws. These help with walking in the snow, and are used for swimming\\n- strong, muscular legs – a bear can swim continuously in the cold Arctic waters for days\\n- nostrils that close when the bear is swimming under water\\n- a large body mass. Polar bears are the largest bears on Earth. An adult male averages 350 to 550 kilograms, and the record is over 1000 kilograms. This large size results in the animal having a small surface area to volume ratio, which reduces heat loss\\n- a 10 centimetre thick layer of insulating fat under the skin\\n- a well developed sense of smell – used to detect the bear's prey\\n- bumps on the pads of the paws to provide grip on the ice\\n- short, powerful claws, which also provide grip, and are needed for holding the heavy prey.\\n\\nThe polar bear is thought to have evolved from a smaller species, the brown bear, about 150,000 years ago. How did it evolve its adaptations for life in the Arctic? Let's consider just one of the adaptations, the thick white fur.\\n\\nThere are two main selection pressures in favour of thick white fur. The first is the need for insulation to reduce heat loss. The polar bear often has to survive temperatures of -30°C, and temperatures in the Arctic can fall as low as -70°C. The second is camouflage; white fur camouflages the animal against the snow so that it can approach its prey unseen and then attack it.\",\n",
       "  'Among the brown bears that were the ancestors of the polar bear there would have been variations in fur length and colour. When some of these bears came to live in colder, more northerly habitats, those individuals with longer and paler fur would have had a selective advantage over others with shorter, darker fur. Any gene mutations that produced long, pale fur increased this advantage. Bears with these genes were less likely to die from the cold, or from lack of food. As a result, well-adapted bears were more likely to reproduce and pass on their genes. Over many thousands of years more mutations and selection for long, white fur produced the adaptation we see in the polar bear today. The same process of natural selection is thought to have happened to bring about the other adaptations shown by the polar bear.\\n\\n### DID YOU KNOW?\\n\\nPolar bear fur appears to be white, but in fact the individual hairs are actually transparent. The white colour results from light being refracted through the clear hair strands.\\n\\n### CAN WE OBSERVE NATURAL SELECTION IN ACTION?\\n\\nMost animals and plants reproduce slowly, so it takes a long time for natural selection to have an observable effect. To observe natural selection happening we can study organisms that reproduce quickly, such as bacteria or insects.\\n---\\n## ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE IN BACTERIA\\n\\nAntibiotics are chemicals that kill or reduce the growth of microorganisms (Figure 19.6). They are used in medicine mainly to treat bacterial infections, although a few antibiotics are effective against fungal pathogens. Antibiotics do not work on viruses, so they are no use in treating any disease caused by a virus.\\n\\nNatural antibiotics are produced by bacteria and fungi. They give a microorganism an advantage over other microorganisms when competing for nutrients and other resources, since the antibiotic kills the competing organisms.',\n",
       "  \"Alexander Fleming discovered the first antibiotic in 1929. It is made by the mould Penicillium, and is called penicillin. Penicillin kills bacteria, and was first used to treat bacterial infections in the 1940s. Since then other natural antibiotics have been discovered, and many more have been chemically synthesised in laboratories. The use of antibiotics has increased dramatically, particularly over the last 20 years. We now almost expect to be given an antibiotic for even the most minor of ailments. This can be dangerous, as it leads to the development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, so that the antibiotics are no longer effective in preventing bacterial infection.\\n\\nFigure 19.6 This photo shows a colony of bacteria growing on a petri dish of nutrient agar. The circular discs contain different antibiotics. The discs have clear areas around them, where the bacteria have been killed by the antibiotic diffusing out from the discs.\\n\\n### DID YOU KNOW?\\n\\nA particularly worrying example of a resistant bacterium is MRSA. MRSA stands for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. It is sometimes called a 'super bug' because it is resistant to many antibiotics including methicillin (a type of penicillin). It is a particular problem in hospitals where it is responsible for many difficult-to-treat infections.\\n\\nResistance starts when a random mutation gives a bacterium resistance to a particular antibiotic. In a situation where the antibiotic is widely used, the new resistant bacterium has an advantage over non-resistant bacteria of the same type. The resistant strain of bacterium will survive and multiply in greater numbers than the non-resistant type. Bacteria reproduce very quickly – the generation time of a bacterium (the time it takes to divide into two daughter cells) can be as short as 20 minutes. This means that there could be 72 generations in a single day, producing a population of millions of resistant bacteria.\",\n",
       "  \"Resistant bacteria will not be killed by the antibiotic, meaning the antibiotic is no longer effective in controlling the disease.\\n\\nBacterial resistance to antibiotics was first noticed in hospitals in the 1950s, and has grown to be a major problem today. The resistant bacteria have a selective advantage over non-resistant bacteria – they are 'fitter'. In effect, the bacteria have evolved as a result of natural selection.\\n\\nDoctors are now more reluctant to prescribe antibiotics. They know that by using them less, the bacteria with resistance have less of an advantage and will not become as widespread.\\n\\n### HINT\\n\\nSome people talk about bacteria becoming immune to antibiotics. This is a misunderstanding. Immunity happens in people – we become immune to microorganisms that infect us, as a result of the immune response. Bacteria become resistant to antibiotics.\\n\\n## PESTICIDE RESISTANCE IN INSECTS\\n\\nJust as pathogenic bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics, insect pests can develop resistance to insecticides. The powerful insecticide DDT was first used in the 1940s (see Chapter 15). By the 1950s many species of insect (e.g. mosquitoes) appeared to be resistant to DDT. The resistant insects had developed a gene mutation that stopped them being killed by the insecticide.\\n---\\nWhile DDT continued to be used, the resistant insects had a selective advantage over the non-resistant ones. They survived to breed, so that with each generation the numbers of resistant insects in the population increased.\\n\\nThe same thing has happened with modern insecticides. There are now hundreds of examples of insect pests that have developed resistance to different insecticides.\\n\\n## SELECTIVE BREEDING\",\n",
       "  \"## SELECTIVE BREEDING\\n\\nAbout 12000 years ago, the human way of life changed significantly. Humans began to grow plants and keep animals for milk and meat. They became farmers rather than hunters. This change first took place in the Middle East. Similar changes took place a little later in the Americas (where potatoes and maize were being grown) and in the Far East (where rice was first cultivated).\\n\\nIn the Middle East, humans first grew the cereal plants wheat and barley, and kept sheep and goats. Later, their livestock included cattle and pigs. Cultivating crops and keeping stock animals made it possible for permanent settlements to appear – life in villages began. Because of the more certain food supply, there was spare time, for the first time ever, for some people to do things other than hunt for food.\\n\\nEver since the cultivation of the first wheat and barley and the domestication of the first stock animals, humans have tried to obtain bigger yields from them. They cross-bred different maize plants (and barley plants) to obtain strains that produced more grain. They bred sheep and goats to give more milk and meat – selective breeding had begun. Today, animals and plants are bred for more than just food. For example, animals are used to produce a range of medicines and for research into the action of drugs.\\n\\nSelective breeding is best described as the breeding of only those individuals with desirable features. It is sometimes called 'artificial selection', as human choice, rather than environmental factors, is providing the selection pressure (compare this with natural selection, described above).\\n\\nThe methods used today for selective breeding are very different from those used only 50 years ago. Modern gene technology makes it possible to create a new strain of plant within weeks, rather than years.\\n\\n## TRADITIONAL SELECTIVE BREEDING\\n\\n### PLANTS\",\n",
       "  \"## TRADITIONAL SELECTIVE BREEDING\\n\\n### PLANTS\\n\\nTraditionally, farmers have bred crop plants of all kinds to obtain increased yields. Probably the earliest example of selective breeding was the cross-breeding of strains of wild wheat. The aim was to produce wheat with a much increased yield of grain and with shorter, stronger stems (Figure 19.7). This wheat was used to make bread.\\n\\n| Stage | Description | Wheat Type |\\n|-------|-------------|------------|\\n| 1 | About 11,000 years ago, two strains of wild wheat were cultivated by farmers. Initially, all attempts at cross-breeding to produce wheats with a better yield gave only sterile offspring. | Triticum monococcum (wild einkorn wheat) - unknown wild wheat |\\n| 2 | About 8000 years ago, a fertile hybrid wheat appeared from these two wild wheats. This was called emmer wheat and had a much higher yield than either of the original wheats. | Fertile hybrid wheat - Triticum turgidum (wild emmer wheat) |\\n| 3 | The emmer wheat was cross-bred with another wild wheat to produce wheat very similar to the wheats used today to make bread. This new wheat had an even bigger yield and was much easier to 'process' to make flour. | Triticum aestivum (bread wheat) |\\n\\nFigure 19.7 Modern wheat is the result of selective breeding by early farmers.\\n---\\n## VARIATION AND SELECTION\\n\\n### NATURAL SELECTION, EVOLUTION AND SELECTIVE BREEDING\\n\\n**DID YOU KNOW?**\\nThe production of modern bread wheats by selective breeding is probably one of the earliest examples of producing genetically modified food. Each original wild wheat species had 14 chromosomes per cell. The wild emmer hybrid had 28 chromosomes per cell. Modern bread wheat has 42 chromosomes per cell. Selective breeding has modified the genetic make-up of wheat.\",\n",
       "  'Other plants have been selectively bred for certain characteristics. Brassica is a genus of cabbage-like plants. One species of wild brassica (Brassica olera) was selectively bred to give several strains, each with specific features (see Figure 19.8). Some of the strains had large leaves, others had large flower heads, and others produced large buds.\\n\\n| Original Wild Brassica | Selectively Bred Varieties |\\n|------------------------|----------------------------|\\n| Central plant          | Brussels sprouts (lateral buds) |\\n|                        | Cabbage (terminal bud) |\\n|                        | Cauliflower (flower cluster) |\\n|                        | Broccoli (flowers and stems) |\\n|                        | Kohlrabi (stem) |\\n|                        | Kale (leaves) |\\n\\nFigure 19.8 Selectively breeding the original wild brassica plants to enhance certain features has produced several familiar vegetables.\\n\\nSelective breeding has produced many familiar vegetables. Besides the ones produced from Brassica, selective breeding of wild Solanum plants has produced the many strains of potatoes that are eaten today. Carrots and parsnips are also the result of selective breeding programmes. Crop plants are bred to produce strains that:\\n\\n- give higher yields\\n- are resistant to certain diseases (the diseases would reduce the yields)\\n- are resistant to certain insect pest damage (the damage would reduce the yield)\\n- are hardier (so that they survive in harsher climates or are productive for longer periods of the year)\\n- have a better balance of nutrients in the crop (for example, plants that contain more of the types of amino acids needed by humans).\\n---\\nVARIATION AND SELECTION                  NATURAL SELECTION, EVOLUTION AND SELECTIVE BREEDING                         229\\n\\nFigure 19.9 shows a field of potato plants. Some have been bred to be resistant to insect pests, while others were not selectively bred in this way.',\n",
       "  \"### DID YOU KNOW?\\nPlant breeders do not just breed plants for food. Nearly all garden flowers are the result of selective breeding. Breeders have selected flowers to have a particular size, shape, colour and fragrance. Roses and orchids are among the most selectively bred of our garden plants.\\n\\nFigure 19.9 Selective breeding can reduce damage by pests. The plants on the right have been bred to be resistant to a fungal pest. Plants on the left are not resistant to the pest.\\n\\n### ANIMALS\\n\\nFarmers have bred stock animals for similar reasons to the breeding of crops. They have selected for animals that:\\n\\n- produce more meat, milk or eggs\\n- produce more fur or better quality fur\\n- produce more offspring\\n- show increased resistance to diseases and parasites.\\n\\nAgain, like crop breeding, breeding animals for increased productivity has been practised for thousands of years. A stone tablet found in Iran appears to record the results of breeding domesticated donkeys. It was dated at over 5000 years old.\\n\\nFor many thousands of years, the only way to improve livestock was to mate a male and a female with the features that were desired in the offspring. In cattle, milk yield is an important factor and so high-yielding cows would be bred with bulls from other high-yielding cows.\\n\\nSince about 1950, the technique of artificial insemination (AI) has become widely available. Bulls with many desirable features are kept and semen is obtained from them. The semen is diluted, frozen and stored. Farmers can buy quantities of this semen to inseminate their cows. The semen is transferred into the cow's uterus using a syringe. AI makes it possible for the semen from one prize bull to be used to fertilise many thousands of cows.\",\n",

The 'bodies' of most microorganisms are made of a single cell, although sometimes millions of cells are gathered together to form a colony. The colony of cells may then be visible to the human eye.\\n\\nMicroorganisms have critical roles to play in recycling the waste products of organisms, as well as recycling the organisms themselves when they die. Many types of microorganisms are studied because they cause disease in animals and plants. On the other hand, humans have made use of the great reproductive capacity of microorganisms to make useful products, such as food, drink and medicines.\\n\\nThere are several groups that we call microorganisms, including protoctists, bacteria, viruses and some fungi (see Chapter 2).\\n\\nFigure 20.1 shows a few examples of the many types of microorganisms.\\n\\n| Type of Microorganism | Size |\\n|------------------------|------|\\n| Protozoa and algae | 10 μm |\\n| Bacteria | 1 μm |\\n| Viruses | 0.1 μm - 0.01 μm |\\n| Fungi (moulds) | 100 μm |\\n| Yeast | 3 μm |\",\n",

One micrometre (1 μm) is a millionth of a metre, or a thousandth of a millimetre.\\n---\\n## FERMENTATION AND BIOTECHNOLOGY\\n\\nFermentation and fermenters are terms that you will encounter if you are involved in the growth of microorganisms. What do these words mean? Many microorganisms respire anaerobically (see Chapter 1), and originally, fermentation meant any anaerobic respiration process involving microorganisms, such as the fermentation of sugars by yeast. Nowadays, the word is used more generally to define other metabolic processes carried out by microorganisms, many of which are aerobic. Fermentation is normally used to make a useful product.\\n\\nThis overlaps with the definition of biotechnology, which means using any organisms (but mainly microbes) to make products that are useful to humans. Although the word itself is relatively new, humans have been using biotechnology processes for thousands of years without knowing it. Since ancient times, fermentation by yeast has been used to produce bread. Yoghurt is made by the action of bacteria on milk, and other bacteria and moulds are used in cheese manufacture.\\n\\nOur ancestors used biotechnology to make products like these, but they did not understand how they were made and had no idea of the existence of microorganisms. Nowadays we understand what is happening when fermentation takes place, and can use biotechnology to produce not just foods but also a huge range of products, from medicines like penicillin to chemicals such as enzymes and fuels.\\n\\nModern biotechnology also allows us to alter the genes of microorganisms so that they code for new products. This is called genetic engineering. It is a topic that you will read about in Chapter 21.\\n\\n## TRADITIONAL BIOTECHNOLOGY – MAKING FOOD AND DRINKS',\n",

Commercial wine production takes place in large containers called vats which prevent air reaching the wine and ensure conditions remain anaerobic. Homemade wine is produced in small-scale fermenters fitted with an 'airlock', which allows carbon dioxide to escape but prevents the entry of oxygen (Figure 20.2). The alcohol increases in concentration until it kills the yeast cells, at which point fermentation stops.\\n\\nBeer is made from barley. Barley contains starch rather than sugars so the starch needs to be broken down first. This happens by allowing the barley seeds to germinate. When they start to germinate they produce the enzyme amylase, which breaks down starch into the sugar maltose. Amylase breaks down starch into the sugar maltose. Later, the maltose from the seeds is fermented by yeast in a large open vat (Figure 20.3).\\n---\\nMICROORGANISMS AND GENETIC MODIFICATION | USING MICROORGANISMS\\n\\nFigure 20.2 A small fermenter for producing homemade wine.

       "  \"## MAKING BREAD\\n\\nYeast is also used to make bread. Wheat flour and water are mixed together and yeast added, forming the bread dough. Enzymes from the original cereal grains break down starch to sugars, which are respired by the yeast. Extra sugar may be added at this stage. In bread-making, the yeast begins by respiring aerobically, producing water and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide makes the dough rise. When the air runs out, conditions become anaerobic, so the yeast begins to respire anaerobically making ethanol and more carbon dioxide.\\n\\nLater, when the dough is baked in the oven, the gas bubbles expand. This gives the bread a light, cellular texture (Figure 20.4). Baking also kills the yeast cells and evaporates any ethanol from the fermentation.\\n\\nFigure 20.4 (a) The 'holes' in this bread were produced by bubbles of carbon dioxide released from the respiration of the yeast. (b) Bread that is made without yeast is called unleavened bread. What is the difference in texture and appearance between leavened and unleavened bread?\\n\\n## ACTIVITY 1\\n\\n### PRACTICAL: INVESTIGATING THE RATE OF ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION IN YEAST\\n\\nSafety note: Wear eye protection and avoid skin contact with the indicator.\\n\\nSome simple apparatus and materials can be used to investigate the rate of anaerobic respiration in yeast.\\n\\nA small amount of water is gently boiled in a boiling tube to remove any air that is dissolved in the water. The water is allowed to cool, and a small amount of sugar (glucose or sucrose) is dissolved in the water.

The air is filtered to prevent contamination.\\n\\nMany microorganisms produce acidic waste products, so fermenters have to be made of materials which will not corrode, such as stainless steel or special alloys.\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\n\\nMany microorganisms use an external food source from their growth medium to obtain energy. In doing this, they change substances in the medium. This is the modern meaning of fermentation. It is used by humans to make many important products. The use of microorganisms to make products useful to humans is called biotechnology.\\n\\nWhen fermentation is completed, the products are collected through an outlet pipe.

       "  \"If the inside of the fermenter and the new nutrients are not sterile, two problems are likely to develop. Firstly, any bacteria or fungi that manage to get in would compete with the organism in the culture, reducing the yield of product. Secondly, the product would become contaminated with waste products or cells of the 'foreign' organism. The methods used to prevent contamination by unwanted microorganisms such as filtering the air and sterilising the fermenter using steam, are known as 'aseptic precautions'.\\n---\\n                motor\\n                  |\\nsteam inlet ---->[|]\\ninlet 'X' ----->[|]    acid/alkali ---> steam outlet\\nPenicillium -->[|]     inlet       ---> exhaust outlet\\ninlet           |\\n                |\\n                |      cold water outlet\\n                |             |\\n         +------+------+      |\\n         |             |      |\\ncold     |     [ ]     |<---- stirring paddle\\nwater    |     [ ]     |\\njacket   |     [ ]     |\\n         |     [ ]     |\\n         |      _      |\\ncold     |     |_|     |\\nwater    +-------------+\\ninlet --->      |\\n                |\\n         air inlet\\n           |\\n        [filter]\\n           |\\n        outlet for harvesting penicillin\\n\\n---\\n244 MICROORGANISMS AND GENETIC MODIFICATION | USING MICROORGANISMS\\n\\nSKILLS CRITICAL THINKING\\n\\n5.

This has two advantages – it saves money (since less is used) and it means that the food contains less sugar and is healthier.',\n",
       "  '4. Human growth hormone\\nThe pituitary gland of some children does not produce enough of this hormone and they show a slow rate of growth. Injections of growth hormone from genetically modified bacteria restore normal growth patterns.\\n\\n5. Bovine somatotrophin (BST) (a growth hormone in cattle)\\nThis hormone increases the milk yield of cows and increases the muscle (meat) production of bulls. Giving injections of BST to dairy cattle can increase the milk yield by up to 10kg per day. To do this they need more food, but this increased cost is more than offset by the increased income from the increased milk yield (Table 21.1).\\n\\n6. Human vaccines\\nBacteria have been genetically modified to produce the antigens of the hepatitis B virus. This is used in the vaccine against hepatitis B. The body makes antibodies against the antigens but there is no risk of contracting the actual disease from the vaccination.\\n\\nTable 21.1 Effects of BST on milk yield.\\n\\n| | Feed / kg per day | Milk output / kg per day | Milk to feed ratio |\\n|------------|------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|\\n| without BST | 34.1 | 27.9 | 0.82 |\\n| with BST | 37.8 | 37.3 | 0.99 |\\n\\nSince the basic techniques of transferring genes were developed, many unicellular organisms have been genetically modified to produce useful products. Techniques for transferring genes into plants and animals have also been developed.\\n\\n## PRODUCING GENETICALLY MODIFIED PLANTS\\n\\nThe gene technology described so far can transfer DNA from one cell to another cell. In the case of bacteria, this is fine – a bacterium only has one cell. But plants have billions of cells and to genetically modify a plant, each cell must receive the new gene. So, any procedure for genetically modifying plants has two main stages:\\n\\n- introducing the new gene or genes into plant cells\\n- producing whole plants from just a few cells.',\n",

       "\"### KEY POINT\\nOsmosis in cells is the net movement of water from a dilute solution to a more concentrated solution across the partially permeable cell membrane.\\n\\n## SPECIALISED EXCHANGE SURFACES\\n\\nAll cells exchange substances with their surroundings, but some parts of animals or plants are specially adapted for the exchange of materials because they have a very large surface area in proportion to their volume. In animals, two examples are the alveoli (air sacs) of the lungs (Chapter 3) and the villi of the small intestine (Chapter 4). Diffusion is a slow process, and organs that rely on diffusion need a large surface over which it can take place. The alveoli allow the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide to take place between the air and the blood during breathing. The villi of the small intestine provide a large surface area for the absorption of digested food. In plants, exchange surfaces are also adapted by having a large surface area, such as the spongy mesophyll of the leaf (Chapter 10) and the root hairs.\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\n'Adapted' or 'an adaptation' means that the structure of a cell or an organism is suited to its function. It is a word that is very commonly used in biology, and will appear again in many of the chapters of this book. We also use it when we say that organisms are adapted to their environment.\\n\\n## CELLS, TISSUES AND ORGANS\\n\\nCells with a similar function are grouped together as tissues. For example, the muscle of your arm contains millions of similar muscle cells, all specialised for one function – contraction to move the arm bones. This is muscle tissue. However, a muscle also contains other tissues, such as blood, nervous tissue and epithelium (lining tissue). A collection of several tissues carrying out a particular function is called an organ. The main organs of the human body are shown in Figure 1.14. Plants also have tissues and organs. Leaves, roots, stems and flowers are all plant organs.\\nThere are thousands of different chemical reactions that take place inside cells. A key function of a cell membrane is to separate cell functions into different compartments so they don't take place together. For example, the reactions and enzymes of aerobic respiration are kept inside the mitochondria, separate from the rest of the cytoplasm.\\n---\\n20   ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES    LIFE PROCESSES\\n\\nCHAPTER QUESTIONS\\n\\nMore questions on life processes can be found at the end of Unit 1 on page 29.\\n\\nSKILLS   CRITICAL THINKING\\n\\n1 Which of the following comparisons of animal and plant cells is not true?\\n\\n| Animal cells | Plant cells |\\n|--------------|-------------|\\n| A | do not have chloroplasts | have chloroplasts |\\n| B | have mitochondria | do not have mitochondria |\\n| C | have temporary vacuoles | have permanent vacuoles |\\n| D | do not have cellulose cell walls | have cellulose cell walls |\\n\\n2 Which of the following descriptions is correct?\\nA The cell wall is freely permeable and the cell membrane is partially\\n  permeable\\nB The cell wall is partially permeable and the cell membrane is freely\\n  permeable\\nC Both the cell wall and the cell membrane are freely permeable\\nD Both the cell wall and the cell membrane are partially permeable\\n\\n3 What are the products of anaerobic respiration in yeast?\\nA ethanol and carbon dioxide    B lactate and carbon dioxide\\nC carbon dioxide and water      D ethanol and water\\n\\nSKILLS   INTERPRETATION\\n\\n4 a Draw a diagram of a plant cell.

Better still, you may be able to do this experiment and provide your own results.\\n\\nIf the curve doesn't turn out quite like the one in Figure 1.6, can you suggest why this is? How could you improve the experiment to get more reliable results?\\n---\\n# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES | LIFE PROCESSES\\n\\n## HOW THE CELL GETS ITS ENERGY\\n\\nA cell needs a source of energy in order to be able to carry out all the processes needed for life. It gets this energy by breaking down food molecules to release the stored chemical energy that they contain. This process is called respiration. Many people think that respiration means the same as 'breathing', but although there are links between the two processes, the biological meaning of respiration is very different.\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\nRespiration is called an oxidation reaction, because oxygen is used to break down food molecules.\\n\\nRespiration happens in all the cells of our body. Oxygen is used to oxidise food, and carbon dioxide (and water) are released as waste products. The main food oxidised is a sugar called glucose. Glucose contains stored chemical energy that can be converted into other forms of energy that the cell can use. It is rather like burning a fuel to get the energy out of it, except that burning releases most of the energy as heat. Respiration releases some heat energy, but most is used to make a substance called ATP (see below). The energy stored in the ATP molecules can then be used for a variety of purposes, such as:\\n\\n- contraction of muscle cells, producing movement\\n- active transport of molecules and ions (see page 17)\\n- building large molecules, such as proteins\\n- cell division.\\n\\nThe energy released as heat is also used to maintain a constant body temperature in mammals and birds (see Chapter 8).\\nb Write down three differences between the cell you have drawn and a\\n  'typical' animal cell.\\n\\n5 Write a short description of the nature and function of enzymes. Include in\\nyour description:\\n■ a definition of an enzyme\\n■ a description of the 'lock and key' model of enzyme action\\n■ an explanation of the difference between intracellular and extracellular\\n  enzymes.\\nYour description should be about a page in length, including a labelled\\ndiagram.\\n\\nSKILLS   ANALYSIS\\n\\n6 The graph shows the effect of temperature on an enzyme.

Nearly all cells have a nucleus. The few types that don't are usually dead (e.g. the xylem vessels in a stem, Chapter 11) or don't live for very long (e.g. red blood cells, Chapter 5). The nucleus controls the activities of the cell. It contains **chromosomes** (46 in human cells) which carry the genetic material, or **genes**. Genes control the activities in the cell by determining which proteins the cell can make. The DNA remains in the nucleus, but the instructions for making proteins are carried out of the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where the proteins are assembled on tiny structures called **ribosomes**. A cell contains thousands of ribosomes, but they are too small to be seen through a light microscope.\\n\\nOne very important group of proteins found in cells are **enzymes**. Enzymes control the chemical reactions that take place in the cytoplasm.\\n\\nAll cells are surrounded by a **cell membrane**, sometimes called the cell surface membrane to distinguish it from other membranes inside the cell. This is a thin layer like a 'skin' on the surface of the cell. It forms a boundary between the cytoplasm of the cell and the outside. However, it is not a complete barrier. Some chemicals can pass into the cell and others can pass out. We say that the membrane is **partially permeable**. The membrane can go further than this and actually control the movement of some substances – it is **selectively permeable**.\\n\\nOne organelle that is found in the cytoplasm of all living cells is the **mitochondrion** (plural mitochondria). In cells that need a lot of energy such as muscle or nerve cells, there are many mitochondria. This gives us a clue to their function. They carry out some of the reactions of **respiration** (see page 11) releasing energy that the cell can use. Most of the energy from respiration is released in the mitochondria.\\n\\n## PLANT CELLS\""

Nearly all cells have a nucleus. The few types that don't are usually dead (e.g. the xylem vessels in a stem, Chapter 11) or don't live for very long (e.g. red blood cells, Chapter 5). The nucleus controls the activities of the cell. It contains **chromosomes** (46 in human cells) which carry the genetic material, or **genes**. Genes control the activities in the cell by determining which proteins the cell can make. The DNA remains in the nucleus, but the instructions for making proteins are carried out of the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where the proteins are assembled on tiny structures called **ribosomes**. A cell contains thousands of ribosomes, but they are too small to be seen through a light microscope.\\n\\nOne very important group of proteins found in cells are **enzymes**. Enzymes control the chemical reactions that take place in the cytoplasm.\\n\\nAll cells are surrounded by a **cell membrane**, sometimes called the cell surface membrane to distinguish it from other membranes inside the cell. This is a thin layer like a 'skin' on the surface of the cell. It forms a boundary between the cytoplasm of the cell and the outside. However, it is not a complete barrier. Some chemicals can pass into the cell and others can pass out. We say that the membrane is **partially permeable**. The membrane can go further than this and actually control the movement of some substances – it is **selectively permeable**.\\n\\nOne organelle that is found in the cytoplasm of all living cells is the **mitochondrion** (plural mitochondria). In cells that need a lot of energy such as muscle or nerve cells, there are many mitochondria. This gives us a clue to their function.

Most of the energy from respiration is released in the mitochondria.\\n\\n## PLANT CELLS\""

      "## SPECIALISED EXCHANGE SURFACES\n",
      "\n",
      "All cells exchange substances with their surroundings, but some parts of animals or plants are specially adapted for the exchange of materials because they have a very large surface area in proportion to their volume. In animals, two examples are the alveoli (air sacs) of the lungs (Chapter 3) and the villi of the small intestine (Chapter 4). Diffusion is a slow process, and organs that rely on diffusion need a large surface over which it can take place. The alveoli allow the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide to take place between the air and the blood during breathing. The villi of the small intestine provide a large surface area for the absorption of digested food. In plants, exchange surfaces are also adapted by having a large surface area, such as the spongy mesophyll of the leaf (Chapter 10) and the root hairs.\n",

      "### KEY POINT\n",
      "'Adapted' or 'an adaptation' means that the structure of a cell or an organism is suited to its function.

For example, the muscle of your arm contains millions of similar muscle cells, all specialised for one function – contraction to move the arm bones. This is muscle tissue. However, a muscle also contains other tissues, such as blood, nervous tissue and epithelium (lining tissue). A collection of several tissues carrying out a particular function is called an organ. The main organs of the human body are shown in Figure 1.14. Plants also have tissues and organs. Leaves, roots, stems and flowers are all plant organs.\n",
      "There are thousands of different chemical reactions that take place inside cells. A key function of a cell membrane is to separate cell functions into different compartments so they don't take place together. For example, the reactions and enzymes of aerobic respiration are kept inside the mitochondria, separate from the rest of the cytoplasm.\n",

      "\n",
      "A cell needs a source of energy in order to be able to carry out all the processes needed for life. It gets this energy by breaking down food molecules to release the stored chemical energy that they contain. This process is called respiration. Many people think that respiration means the same as 'breathing', but although there are links between the two processes, the biological meaning of respiration is very different.\n",
      "\n",
      "### KEY POINT\n",
      "Respiration is called an oxidation reaction, because oxygen is used to break down food molecules.\n",
      "\n",
      "Respiration happens in all the cells of our body. Oxygen is used to oxidise food, and carbon dioxide (and water) are released as waste products. The main food oxidised is a sugar called glucose. Glucose contains stored chemical energy that can be converted into other forms of energy that the cell can use. It is rather like burning a fuel to get the energy out of it, except that burning releases most of the energy as heat. Respiration releases some heat energy, but most is used to make a substance called ATP (see below). The energy stored in the ATP molecules can then be used for a variety of purposes, such as:\n",
