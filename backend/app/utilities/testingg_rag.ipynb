The simplest organisms are made from single cells (Figure 1.1) but more complex plants and animals are composed of millions of cells. In many-celled (multicellular) organisms, there may be hundreds of different types of cells with different structures. They are specialised so that they can carry out particular functions in the animal or plant. Despite all the differences, there are basic features that are the same in all cells.\\n\\n▲ Figure 1.1 Many simple organisms have 'bodies' made from single cells.

       "  \"## CELL STRUCTURE\\n\\nThis part of the book describes the cell structure of 'higher' organisms such as animals, plants and fungi. The cells of bacteria are simpler in structure and will be described in Chapter 2.\\n\\nMost cells contain certain parts such as the nucleus, cytoplasm and cell membrane. Some cells have structures missing, for instance red blood cells are unusual in that they have no nucleus. The first chapter in a biology textbook will usually present diagrams of 'typical' plant and animal cells. In fact, there is really no such thing as a 'typical' cell. Humans, for example, are composed of hundreds of different kinds of cells – from nerve cells to blood cells, skin cells to liver cells. What we really mean by a 'typical' cell is a general diagram that shows all the features that you will find in most cells (Figure 1.2). However, not all these are present in all cells – for example the cells in the parts of a plant that are not green do not contain chloroplasts.\\n\\n| animal cell | plant cell |\\n|-------------|------------|\\n| nucleus | cell wall |\\n| cell membrane | cell membrane (inside cell wall) |\\n| mitochondria | vacuole |\\n| cytoplasm | cytoplasm |\\n| | mitochondria |\\n| | chloroplasts |\\n| | nucleus |\\n\\n▲ Figure 1.2 The structure of a 'typical' animal and plant cell.\",\n",
       "  \"▲ Figure 1.2 The structure of a 'typical' animal and plant cell.\\n\\nThe living material that makes up a cell is called cytoplasm. It has a texture rather like sloppy jelly, in other words somewhere between a solid and a liquid. Unlike a jelly, it is not made of one substance but is a complex material made of many different structures. You can't see many of these structures under an ordinary light microscope. An electron microscope has a much higher magnification and can show the details of these structures, which are called organelles (Figure 1.3).\\n---\\n# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES | LIFE PROCESSES\",\n",
       "  \"The largest organelle in the cell is the **nucleus**. Nearly all cells have a nucleus. The few types that don't are usually dead (e.g. the xylem vessels in a stem, Chapter 11) or don't live for very long (e.g. red blood cells, Chapter 5). The nucleus controls the activities of the cell. It contains **chromosomes** (46 in human cells) which carry the genetic material, or **genes**. Genes control the activities in the cell by determining which proteins the cell can make. The DNA remains in the nucleus, but the instructions for making proteins are carried out of the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where the proteins are assembled on tiny structures called **ribosomes**. A cell contains thousands of ribosomes, but they are too small to be seen through a light microscope.\\n\\nOne very important group of proteins found in cells are **enzymes**. Enzymes control the chemical reactions that take place in the cytoplasm.\",\n",
       "  \"One very important group of proteins found in cells are **enzymes**. Enzymes control the chemical reactions that take place in the cytoplasm.\\n\\nAll cells are surrounded by a **cell membrane**, sometimes called the cell surface membrane to distinguish it from other membranes inside the cell. This is a thin layer like a 'skin' on the surface of the cell. It forms a boundary between the cytoplasm of the cell and the outside. However, it is not a complete barrier. Some chemicals can pass into the cell and others can pass out. We say that the membrane is **partially permeable**. The membrane can go further than this and actually control the movement of some substances – it is **selectively permeable**.\\n\\nOne organelle that is found in the cytoplasm of all living cells is the **mitochondrion** (plural mitochondria). In cells that need a lot of energy such as muscle or nerve cells, there are many mitochondria. This gives us a clue to their function. They carry out some of the reactions of **respiration** (see page 11) releasing energy that the cell can use. Most of the energy from respiration is released in the mitochondria.\\n\\n## PLANT CELLS\",\n",
       "  \"## PLANT CELLS\\n\\nAll of the structures you have seen so far are found in both animal and plant cells. However, some structures are only ever found in plant cells. There are three in particular – the cell wall, a permanent vacuole and chloroplasts.\\n\\nThe **cell wall** is a layer of non-living material that is found outside the cell membrane of plant cells. It is made mainly of a carbohydrate called **cellulose**, although other chemicals may be added to the wall in some cells. Cellulose is a tough material that helps the cell keep its shape and is one reason why the 'body' of a plant has a fixed shape. Animal cells do not have a cell wall and tend to be more variable in shape. Plant cells absorb water, producing an internal pressure that pushes against adjacent cells, giving the plant support (see Chapter 11). Without a cell wall strong enough to resist these pressures, this method of support would be impossible. The cell wall is porous, so it is not a barrier to water or dissolved substances. We call it freely permeable.\",\n",
       "  'Mature (fully grown) plant cells often have a large central space surrounded by a membrane, called a **vacuole**. This vacuole is a permanent feature of the cell. It is filled with a watery liquid called cell sap, which is a store of dissolved sugars, mineral ions and other solutes. Animal cells do contain vacuoles, but they are only small, temporary structures.\\n\\nCells of the green parts of plants, especially the leaves, contain another very important organelle, the **chloroplast**. Chloroplasts absorb light energy to make food in the process of photosynthesis (see Chapter 10). They contain a green pigment called **chlorophyll**. Cells from the parts of a plant that are not green, such as the flowers, roots and woody stems, have no chloroplasts.\\n\\n| KEY POINT |\\n|-----------|\\n| Nearly all cells contain cytoplasm, a nucleus, a cell membrane and mitochondria. As well as these structures, plant cells have a cell wall and a permanent vacuole, and plant cells that photosynthesise contain chloroplasts. |\\n---\\nMARKDOWN_EXTRACTION_FAILED\\n---\\n# ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES | LIFE PROCESSES',\n",
       "  'The molecule that an enzyme acts on is called its substrate. Each enzyme has a small area on its surface called the active site. The substrate attaches to the active site of the enzyme. The reaction then takes place and products are formed. When the substrate joins up with the active site it lowers the energy needed for the reaction to start, allowing the products to be formed more easily.\\n\\nEnzymes also catalyse reactions where large molecules are built up from smaller ones. In this case, several substrate molecules attach to the active site, the reaction takes place and the larger product molecule is formed. The product then leaves the active site.\\n\\nThe substrate fits into the active site of the enzyme like a key fitting into a lock. Just as a key will only fit one lock, a substrate will only fit into the active site of a particular enzyme. This is known as the lock and key model of enzyme action. It is the reason why enzymes are specific, i.e. an enzyme will only catalyse one reaction.\\n\\n| 1 | 2 |\\n|---|---|\\n|  |  |\\n| 4 | 3 |\\n|  |  |',\n",

The substrate fits into the active site, and products are formed. This happens more easily than without the enzyme – so enzymes act as catalysts.\\n\\nAfter an enzyme molecule has catalysed a reaction, the product is released from the active site, and the enzyme is free to act on more substrate molecules.\\n\\n## FACTORS AFFECTING ENZYMES\\n\\nA number of factors affect the activity of enzymes. The rate of reaction may be increased by raising the concentration of the enzyme or the substrate. Two other factors that affect enzymes are temperature and pH.\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\n'Optimum' temperature means the 'best' temperature, in other words the temperature at which the reaction takes place most rapidly.\\n\\n### TEMPERATURE\\n\\nThe effect of temperature on the action of an enzyme is easiest to see as a graph, where we plot the rate of the reaction against temperature (Figure 1.6).\\n\\nEnzymes in the human body have evolved to work best at body temperature (37 °C). The graph in Figure 1.6 shows a peak on the curve at this temperature, which is called the optimum temperature for the enzyme.\",\n",
       "  'As the enzyme is heated up to the optimum temperature, the rise in temperature increases the rate of reaction. This is because higher temperatures give the molecules of the enzyme and the substrate more kinetic energy, so they collide more often. More collisions means that the reaction will take place more frequently.\\n\\n### DID YOU KNOW?\\n\\nKinetic energy is the energy an object has because of its movement. The molecules of enzyme and substrate are moving faster, so they have more kinetic energy.\\n---\\n# 8 ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES | LIFE PROCESSES\\n\\n## Effect of Temperature on Enzyme Action\\n\\nEffect of temperature on the action of an enzyme',\n",

Enzymes are made of protein, and proteins are broken down by heat. From 40 °C upwards, the heat destroys the enzyme. We say that it is denatured. You can see the effect of denaturing when you boil an egg. The egg white is made of protein, and turns from a clear runny liquid into a white solid as the heat denatures the protein. Denaturing changes the shape of the active site so that the substrate will no longer fit into it. Denaturing is permanent – the enzyme molecules will no longer catalyse the reaction.\\n\\nNot all enzymes have an optimum temperature near 37 °C, only those of animals such as mammals and birds, which all have body temperatures close to this value. Enzymes have evolved to work best at the normal body temperature of the organism. Bacteria that always live at an average temperature of 10 °C will probably have enzymes with an optimum temperature near 10 °C.\\n\\n## pH',\n",
       "  '## pH\\n\\nThe pH around the enzyme is also important. The pH inside cells is neutral (pH 7) and most enzymes have evolved to work best at this pH. At extremes of pH either side of neutral, the enzyme activity decreases, as shown in Figure 1.7. The pH at which the enzyme works best is called its optimum pH. Either side of the optimum, the pH affects the structure of the enzyme molecule and changes the shape of its active site, so that the substrate will not fit into it so well.\\n\\nMost enzymes work best at a neutral pH\\n\\n| pH | Rate of enzyme-catalysed reaction (arbitrary units) |\\n|----|---------------------------------------------------|\\n| 5  | Low                                               |\\n| 6  | Medium                                            |\\n| 7  | Peak (Optimum pH)                                 |\\n| 8  | Medium                                            |\\n| 9  | Low                                               |\\n\\nFigure 1.7 Most enzymes work best at a neutral pH.\\n\\n### KEY POINT',\n",

It gets this energy by breaking down food molecules to release the stored chemical energy that they contain. This process is called respiration. Many people think that respiration means the same as 'breathing', but although there are links between the two processes, the biological meaning of respiration is very different.\",\n",
       "  '### KEY POINT\\nRespiration is called an oxidation reaction, because oxygen is used to break down food molecules.\\n\\nRespiration happens in all the cells of our body. Oxygen is used to oxidise food, and carbon dioxide (and water) are released as waste products. The main food oxidised is a sugar called glucose. Glucose contains stored chemical energy that can be converted into other forms of energy that the cell can use. It is rather like burning a fuel to get the energy out of it, except that burning releases most of the energy as heat. Respiration releases some heat energy, but most is used to make a substance called ATP (see below). The energy stored in the ATP molecules can then be used for a variety of purposes, such as:\\n\\n- contraction of muscle cells, producing movement\\n- active transport of molecules and ions (see page 17)\\n- building large molecules, such as proteins\\n- cell division.\\n\\nThe energy released as heat is also used to maintain a constant body temperature in mammals and birds (see Chapter 8).\\n\\nThe overall reaction for respiration is:\\n\\n| glucose | + | oxygen | → | carbon dioxide | + | water | (+ energy) |\\n|---------|---|--------|---|----------------|---|-------|------------|\\n| C₆H₁₂O₆ | + | 6O₂    | → | 6CO₂           | + | 6H₂O  | (+ energy) |\\n\\n### DID YOU KNOW?',\n",
       "  \"### DID YOU KNOW?\\n\\nCarbon from the respired glucose passes out into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. The carbon can be traced through this pathway using a radioactive form of carbon called carbon-14.\\n\\nThis is called aerobic respiration, because it uses oxygen. Aerobic respiration happens in the cells of humans and those of animals, plants and many other organisms. It is important to realise that the equation above is only a summary of the process. It actually takes place gradually, as a sequence of small steps, which release the energy of the glucose in small amounts. Each step in the process is catalysed by a different enzyme. The later steps in the process are the aerobic ones, and these release the most energy. They happen in the mitochondria of the cell.\\n\\n## ATP – THE ENERGEY 'CURRENCY' OF THE CELL\\n\\nRespiration releases energy while other cell processes use it up. Cells have a way of passing the energy from respiration to the other processes that need it. They do this using a chemical called adenosine triphosphate or ATP. ATP is present in all living cells.\\n---\\n## ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES | LIFE PROCESSES\",\n",

It transfers energy between the process that releases it (respiration) and the processes in a cell that use it up.\\n\\n## ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION\",\n",
       "  \"## ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION\\n\\nThere are some situations where cells can respire without using oxygen. This is called anaerobic respiration. In anaerobic respiration, glucose is not completely broken down, so less energy is released. The advantage of anaerobic respiration is that it can occur in situations where oxygen is in short supply. Two important examples of this are in yeast cells and muscle cells.\\n\\nYeasts are single-celled fungi. They are used in commercial processes such as making wine and beer, and baking bread. When yeast cells are prevented from getting enough oxygen, they stop respiring aerobically and start to respire anaerobically instead. The glucose is partly broken down into ethanol (alcohol) and carbon dioxide:\\n\\nglucose → ethanol + carbon dioxide (+ some energy)\\n\\nThis process is described in more detail in Chapter 21. The ethanol from this type of respiration is the alcohol formed in wine- and beer-making. The carbon dioxide is the gas that makes bread dough rise.\\n\\nThink about the properties of ethanol – it makes a good fuel and will burn to produce a lot of heat, so it still has a lot of chemical energy 'stored' in it.\",\n",

This happens when a person does a 'burst' of activity, such as a sprint, or quickly lifting a heavy weight. This time the glucose is broken down into a substance called lactate:\\n\\nglucose → lactate (+ some energy)\\n\\nAnaerobic respiration provides enough energy to keep the overworked muscles going for a short period.

       "  'There are three main ways that molecules and ions can move through the membrane.

Diffusion happens when a substance is more concentrated in one place than another.

This difference in concentration is called a concentration gradient. The molecules of carbon dioxide are constantly moving about because of their kinetic energy. The cell membrane is permeable to carbon dioxide, so the molecules can move in either direction through it. Since there is a higher concentration of carbon dioxide molecules inside the cell than outside, over time, more molecules will move from inside to outside than move in the other direction. We say that there is a net movement of the molecules out of the cell (Figure 1.12).\\n\\n![Figure 1.12 Carbon dioxide is produced by respiration, so its concentration builds up inside the cell.

Diffusion is a slow process, and organs that rely on diffusion need a large surface over which it can take place. The alveoli allow the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide to take place between the air and the blood during breathing. The villi of the small intestine provide a large surface area for the absorption of digested food.

The maximum resolution of a light microscope is about 200 nanometres (nm), while with an electron microscope we can distinguish structures less than 1 nm in size. That is why ribosomes are only visible using an electron microscope – they are about 25 nm in diameter. A nanometre (nm) is 10⁻⁹ m, or one millionth of a millimetre.\\n\\nElectron microscopy reveals that much of the cytoplasm is made up of membranes. As well as the cell surface membrane, there are membranes around organelles such as the nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts. In addition, there is an extensive system of membranes running throughout the cytoplasm, called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Some ER is covered in ribosomes, and is called rough ER (Figure 1.15).',\n",
       "  \"Figure 1.15 Rough endoplasmic reticulum is a system of membranes extending throughout the cytoplasm of a cell. It is covered with ribosomes the (tiny dots). Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis.\\n\\nThere are thousands of different chemical reactions that take place inside cells. A key function of a cell membrane is to separate cell functions into different compartments so they don't take place together. For example, the reactions and enzymes of aerobic respiration are kept inside the mitochondria, separate from the rest of the cytoplasm.\\n---\\n20   ORGANISMS AND LIFE PROCESSES    LIFE PROCESSES\\n\\nCHAPTER QUESTIONS\\n\\nMore questions on life processes can be found at the end of Unit 1 on page 29.\\n\\nSKILLS   CRITICAL THINKING\\n\\n1 Which of the following comparisons of animal and plant cells is not true?\\n\\n| Animal cells | Plant cells |\\n|--------------|-------------|\\n| A | do not have chloroplasts | have chloroplasts |\\n| B | have mitochondria | do not have mitochondria |\\n| C | have temporary vacuoles | have permanent vacuoles |\\n| D | do not have cellulose cell walls | have cellulose cell walls |\",\n",

       "  \"There are more than ten million species of organisms alive on Earth today, and many more that once lived on Earth but are now extinct. In order to make sense of this enormous variety biologists classify organisms, putting them into groups. Members of each group are related – they are descended from a common ancestor by the process of evolution (see Chapter 19). This common ancestry is reflected in the similarities of structure and function of the members of a group.\\n\\nThe five major groups of living organisms are plants, animals, fungi, protoctists and bacteria.\\n\\n### PLANTS\\n\\nYou will be familiar with flowering plants, such as those shown in Figure 2.1. This group, or kingdom, also contains simpler plants, such as mosses and ferns. All plants are multicellular, which means that their 'bodies' are made up of many cells. Their main distinguishing feature is that their cells contain chloroplasts and they carry out photosynthesis – the process that uses light energy to convert simple inorganic molecules such as water and carbon dioxide into complex organic compounds (see Chapter 10). One of these organic compounds is the carbohydrate cellulose, and all plants have cell walls made of this material.\",\n",
       "  'Plants can make many other organic compounds as a result of photosynthesis. One of the first to be made is the storage carbohydrate starch, which is often found inside plant cells. Another is the sugar sucrose, which is transported around the plant and is sometimes stored in fruits and other plant organs. The structure and function of flowering plants is dealt with in Unit 3 of this book.\\n\\nFigure 2.1 (a) A pea plant. Its leaves and stem cells contain chloroplasts, giving them their green colour. The white flowers are pollinated by insects. (b) Maize plants are pollinated by wind. These are the male flowers, which make the pollen. (c) The female maize flowers produce seeds after pollination.\\n---\\n## ANIMALS\\n\\nYou will be even more familiar with this kingdom, since it contains the species Homo sapiens, i.e. humans! The variety of the animal kingdom is also enormous, including organisms such as sponges, molluscs, worms, starfish, insects and crustaceans, through to larger animals such as fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals (Figure 2.2). The last five groups are all vertebrates, which means that they have a vertebral column, or backbone. All other animals lack this feature, and are called invertebrates.',\n",
       "  \"Figure 2.2 (a) A housefly. (b) A mosquito, feeding on human blood. Houseflies and mosquitoes are both insects, which make up the largest sub-group of all the animals. About 60% of all animal species are insects. (c) This high jumper's movement is coordinated by a complex nervous system.\\n\\nAnimals are also multicellular organisms. Their cells never contain chloroplasts, so they are unable to carry out photosynthesis. Instead, they gain their nutrition by feeding on other animals or plants. Animal cells also lack cell walls, which allows their cells to change shape, an important feature for organisms that need to move from place to place. Movement in animals is achieved in various ways, but often involves coordination by a nervous system (see Chapter 6). Another feature common to most animals is that they store carbohydrate in their cells as a compound called glycogen (see Chapter 4). The structure and function of animals is dealt with in Unit 2 of this book.\\n\\n## FUNGI\",\n",
       "  '## FUNGI\\n\\nFungi include mushrooms and toadstools, as well as moulds. These groups of fungi are multicellular. Another group of fungi is the yeasts, which are unicellular (made of single cells). Different species of yeasts live everywhere – on the surface of fruits, in soil, water, and even on dust in the air. The yeast powder used for baking contains millions of yeast cells (Figure 2.3). The cells of fungi never contain chloroplasts, so they cannot photosynthesise. Their cells have cell walls, but they are not composed of cellulose (Figure 2.4).\\n\\n### EXTENSION WORK\\n\\nBecause fungi have cell walls, they were once thought to be plants that had lost their chlorophyll. We now know that their cell wall is not made of cellulose as in plants, but of a different chemical called chitin (the same material that makes up the outside skeleton of insects). There are many ways that fungi are very different from plants (the most obvious is that fungi do not photosynthesise) and they are not closely related to plants at all.\\n\\nFigure 2.3 Yeast cells, highly magnified\\n\\nFigure 2.4 Structure of a yeast cell\\n\\n| Part | Description |\\n|------|-------------|\\n| cell wall | made of chitin |\\n| cell surface membrane | |\\n| cytoplasm | |\\n| vacuole | |\\n| nucleus | |',\n",

Most protoctists are microscopic single-celled organisms (Figure 2.8). Some look like animal cells, such as Amoeba, which lives in pond water. These are known as protozoa. Other protoctists have chloroplasts and carry out photosynthesis, so are more like plants. These are called algae.

Their cells are much smaller than those of eukaryotic organisms and have a much simpler structure. To give you some idea of their size, a typical animal cell might be 10 to 50μm in diameter (1 μm, or one micrometre, is a millionth of a metre). Compared with this, a typical bacterium is only 1 to 5μm in length (Figure 2.9) and its volume is thousands of times smaller than that of the animal cell.\\n\\nThere are three basic shapes of bacteria: spheres, rods and spirals, but they all have a similar internal structure (Figure 2.10).\",\n",

Bacterial cell walls are not made of cellulose but a complex compound of sugars and proteins called peptidoglycan. Some species have another layer outside this wall, called a capsule or slime layer. Both give the bacterium extra protection. Underneath the cell wall is the cell membrane, as in other cells. The middle of the cell is made of cytoplasm. Since it is a prokaryotic cell, the bacterium has no nucleus.

However, many bacteria do not have flagella and cannot move by themselves. Other structures present in the cytoplasm include the plasmids. These are small circular rings of DNA, carrying some of the bacterium's genes. Not all bacteria contain plasmids, although about three-quarters of all known species do. Plasmids have very important uses in genetic engineering (see Chapter 21).\\n\\n### KEY POINT\",\n",
       "  \"### KEY POINT\\n\\nPathogens are organisms that cause disease. Many common animal and plant diseases are caused by bacteria or viruses. Most protoctists are free-living, but a few species are pathogens, such as Plasmodium (Figure 2.8). Even some species of fungi can cause disease, e.g. the skin infection called 'athlete's foot' is caused by a mould.\\n\\nSome bacteria contain a form of chlorophyll in their cytoplasm, and can carry out photosynthesis. However, most bacteria feed off other living or dead organisms. Along with the fungi, many bacteria are important decomposers (see Chapter 14), recycling dead organisms and waste products in the soil and elsewhere. Some bacteria are used by humans to make food, such as Lactobacillus bulgaricus, a rod-shaped species used in the production of yoghurt from milk (Figure 2.11). Other species are pathogens, which means that they cause disease (Figure 2.12).\",\n",

       "  \"A virus reproduces by entering the host cell and taking over the host's genetic machinery to make more virus particles. After many virus particles have been made, the host cell dies and the particles are released to infect more cells. Many human diseases are caused in this way, such as influenza ('flu'). Other examples include colds, measles, mumps, polio and rubella ('German measles'). Of course, the reproduction process does not continue forever. Usually, the body's immune system destroys the virus and the person recovers. Sometimes, however, a virus cannot be destroyed by the immune system quickly enough, and it may cause permanent damage or death. With other infections, the virus may attack cells of the immune system itself. This is the case with HIV (the Human Immunodeficiency Virus), which causes the illness called AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome).\\n\\nViruses don't just parasitise animal cells. Some infect plant cells, such as the tobacco mosaic virus (Figure 2.14), which interferes with the ability of the tobacco plant to make chloroplasts, causing mottled patches to develop on the leaves (Figure 2.15).\\n\\n## EXTENSION WORK\",\n",

This chapter looks at these processes, and also deals with some ways that smoking can damage the lungs and stop these vital organs from working properly.\\n\\n## LEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n- Describe the structure of the thorax, including the ribs, intercostal muscles, diaphragm, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli and pleural membranes\\n- Understand the role of the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm in ventilation\\n- Explain how alveoli are adapted for gas exchange by diffusion between air in the lungs and blood in capillaries\\n- Investigate breathing in humans, including the release of carbon dioxide and the effect of exercise\\n- Understand the biological consequences of smoking in relation to the lungs and circulatory system, including coronary heart disease.\\n\\nCells get their energy by oxidising foods such as glucose, during the process called respiration. If cells are to respire aerobically, they need a continuous supply of oxygen from the blood. In addition, carbon dioxide from respiration needs to be removed from the body. In humans, these gases are exchanged between the blood and the air in the lungs.\\n\\n## RESPIRATION AND BREATHING',\n",
       "  \"## RESPIRATION AND BREATHING\\n\\nYou need to understand the difference between respiration and breathing. Respiration is the oxidation reaction that releases energy from foods such as glucose (Chapter 1). Breathing is the mechanism that moves air into and out of the lungs, allowing gas exchange to take place. The lungs and associated structures are often called the 'respiratory system' but this can be confusing. It is better to call them the gas exchange system and this is the term we use in this book.\\n\\n## THE STRUCTURE OF THE GAS EXCHANGE SYSTEM\\n\\nThe lungs are enclosed in the chest or thorax by the ribcage and a muscular sheet of tissue called the diaphragm (Figure 3.1). As you will see, the actions of these two structures bring about the movements of air into and out of the lungs. Joining each rib to the next are two sets of muscles called intercostal muscles ('costals' are rib bones). The diaphragm separates the contents of the thorax from the abdomen. It is not flat, but a shallow dome shape, with a fibrous middle part forming the 'roof' of the dome, and muscular edges forming the walls.\\n---\\n# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY                             BREATHING AND GAS EXCHANGE\",\n",

This is why it is sometimes called the bronchial tree.\\n\\nWhen we breathe in, air enters our nose or mouth and passes down the windpipe or trachea. The trachea splits into two tubes called the bronchi (singular bronchus), one leading to each lung. Each bronchus divides into smaller and smaller tubes called bronchioles, eventually ending at microscopic air sacs, called alveoli (singular alveolus). It is here that gas exchange with the blood takes place.',\n",
       "  \"The walls of trachea and bronchi contain rings of gristle or cartilage. These support the airways and keep them open when we breathe in. They are rather like the rings in a vacuum cleaner hose – without them the hose would squash flat when the cleaner sucks air in.\\n\\nThe inside of the thorax is separated from the lungs by two thin, moist membranes called the pleural membranes. They make up a continuous envelope around the lungs, forming an airtight seal. Between the two membranes is a space called the pleural cavity, filled with a thin layer of liquid called pleural fluid. This acts as lubrication, so that the surfaces of the lungs don't stick to the inside of the chest wall when we breathe.\\n\\n## Figure 3.3 C-shaped cartilage rings in the trachea.\\n\\n[Diagram of esophagus and trachea]\\n\\n| Label | Part |\\n|-------|------|\\n| oesophagus | |\\n| trachea | |\\n| bulge where food is passing down oesophagus | |\\n| C-shaped rings of cartilage in wall of trachea | |\\n\\n### EXTENSION WORK\",\n",

In the trachea, the rings are incomplete, and shaped like a letter 'C'. The open part of the ring is at the back of the trachea, next to where the oesophagus (gullet) lies as it passes through the thorax. When food passes along the oesophagus by peristalsis (see Chapter 4) the gaps in the rings allow the lumps of food to pass through more easily, without the peristaltic wave 'catching' on the rings (Figure 3.3).\\n\\n### KEEPING THE AIRWAYS CLEAN\\n\\nThe trachea and larger airways are lined with a layer of cells that have an important role in keeping the airways clean. Some cells in this lining secrete a sticky liquid called mucus, which traps particles of dirt or bacteria that are breathed in. Other cells are covered with tiny hair-like structures called cilia (Figure 3.4). The cilia beat backward and forward, sweeping the mucus and trapped particles out towards the mouth.

       "  \"## KEY POINT\\n\\nIt is important that you remember the changes in volume and pressure during ventilation. If you have trouble understanding these, think of what happens when you use a bicycle pump. If you push the pump handle, the air in the pump is squashed, its pressure rises and it is forced out of the pump. If you pull on the handle, the air pressure inside the pump falls a little, and air is drawn in from outside. This is similar to what happens in the lungs. In exams, students sometimes talk about the lungs forcing the air in and out – they don't!\\n\\n## GAS EXCHANGE IN THE ALVEOLI\\n\\nYou can tell what is happening during gas exchange if you compare the amounts of different gases in atmospheric air with the air breathed out (Table 3.1).\\n\\n### Table 3.1 Approximate percentage volume of gases in atmospheric (inhaled) and exhaled air\\n\\n| Gas | Atmospheric air / % | Exhaled air / % |\\n|-----|---------------------|-----------------|\\n| nitrogen | 78 | 79 |\\n| oxygen | 21 | 16 |\\n| carbon dioxide | 0.04 | 4 |\\n| other gases (mainly argon) | 1 | 1 |\\n\\n### HINT\",\n",
       "  '### HINT\\n\\nBe careful when interpreting percentages! The percentage of a gas in a mixture can vary, even if the actual amount of the gas stays the same. This is easiest to understand from an example. Imagine you have a bottle containing a mixture of 20% oxygen and 80% nitrogen. If you used a chemical to absorb all the oxygen in the bottle, the nitrogen left would now be 100% of the gas in the bottle, despite the fact that the amount of nitrogen would still be the same. That is why the percentage of nitrogen in inhaled and exhaled air is slightly different.\\n\\nExhaled air is also warmer than atmospheric air, and is saturated with water vapour. The amount of water vapour in the atmosphere varies depending on weather conditions.',\n",

The amount of water vapour in the atmosphere varies depending on weather conditions.\\n\\nClearly, the lungs are absorbing oxygen into the blood and removing carbon dioxide from it. This happens in the alveoli. To do this efficiently, the alveoli must have a structure which brings the air and blood very close together, over a very large surface area. There are enormous numbers of alveoli. It has been calculated that the two lungs contain about 700,000,000 of these tiny air sacs, giving a total surface area of 60 m². That's bigger than the floor area of an average classroom! Viewed through a high-powered microscope, the alveoli look rather like bunches of grapes, and are covered with tiny blood capillaries (Figure 3.7).\\n---\\nANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY                            BREATHING AND GAS EXCHANGE                                                          39\\n\\nFigure 3.7 (a) Alveoli and the surrounding capillary network.

       "  \"Deoxygenated blood is pumped from the heart to the lungs and passes through the capillaries surrounding the alveoli. The blood has come from the respiring tissues of the body, where it has given up some of its oxygen to the cells, and gained carbon dioxide. Around the lungs, the blood is separated from the air inside each alveolus by only two cell layers; the cells making up the wall of the alveolus, and the capillary wall itself. This is a distance of less than a thousandth of a millimetre.\\n\\n### EXTENSION WORK\\n\\nThe thin layer of fluid lining the inside of the alveoli comes from the blood. The capillaries and cells of the alveolar wall are 'leaky' and the blood pressure pushes fluid out from the blood plasma into the alveolus. Oxygen dissolves in this moist surface before it passes through the alveolar wall into the blood.\",\n",
       "  'Because the air in the alveolus has a higher concentration of oxygen than the blood entering the capillary network, oxygen diffuses from the air, across the wall of the alveolus and into the blood. At the same time there is more carbon dioxide in the blood than there is in the air in the lungs. This means that there is a diffusion gradient for carbon dioxide in the other direction, so carbon dioxide diffuses the other way, out of the blood and into the alveolus. The result is that the blood which leaves the capillaries and flows back to the heart has gained oxygen and lost carbon dioxide. The heart then pumps the oxygenated blood around the body again, to supply the respiring cells (see Chapter 5).\\n---\\n40   ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY                       BREATHING AND GAS EXCHANGE',\n",

There is one habit that can upset all of these conditions – smoking.\\n\\nLinks between smoking and diseases of the lungs are now a proven fact. Smoking is associated with lung cancer, bronchitis and emphysema. It is also a major contributing factor to other conditions, such as coronary heart disease and ulcers of the stomach and intestine. Pregnant women who smoke are more likely to give birth to underweight babies.',\n",
       "  \"Coronary heart disease will be described in Chapter 5 after you have studied the structure of the heart. Here we will look at a number of other medical conditions that are caused by smoking.\\n\\n### EFFECTS OF SMOKE ON THE LINING OF THE AIR PASSAGES\\n\\nYou saw above how the lungs are kept free of particles of dirt and bacteria by the action of mucus and cilia. In the trachea and bronchi of a smoker, the cilia are destroyed by the chemicals in cigarette smoke.\\n---\\nThe reduced numbers of cilia mean that the mucus is not swept away from the lungs, but remains to block the air passages. This is made worse by the fact that the smoke irritates the lining of the airways, stimulating the cells to secrete more mucus. The sticky mucus blocking the airways is the source of 'smoker's cough'. Irritation of the bronchial tree, along with infections from bacteria in the mucus, can cause the lung disease bronchitis. Bronchitis blocks normal air flow, so the sufferer has difficulty breathing properly.\\n\\n## EMPHYSEMA\\n\\nEmphysema is another lung disease that kills about 20000 people in Britain every year. Smoking is the cause of one type of emphysema. Smoke damages the walls of the alveoli, which break down and fuse together again, forming enlarged, irregular air spaces (Figure 3.9).\",\n",
       "  'This greatly reduces the surface area for gas exchange, which becomes very inefficient. The blood of a person with emphysema carries less oxygen. In serious cases, this leads to the sufferer being unable to carry out even mild exercise, such as walking. Emphysema patients often have to have a supply of oxygen nearby at all times (Figure 3.10).

In one study, a number of patients in hospital were given a series of questions about their lifestyles. They were asked about their work, hobbies, housing and so on, including a question about how many cigarettes they smoked. The same questionnaire was given to two groups of patients. The first group were all suffering from lung cancer. The second (Control) group were in hospital with various other illnesses, but not lung cancer. To make it a fair comparison, the Control patients were matched with the lung cancer patients for sex, age and so on.\\n\\nWhen the results were compared, one difference stood out (Table 3.2). A greater proportion of the lung cancer patients were smokers than in the Control patients.

       "  '### CARBON MONOXIDE IN SMOKE\\n\\nOne of the harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke is the poisonous gas carbon monoxide. When this gas is breathed in with the smoke, it enters the bloodstream and interferes with the ability of the blood to carry oxygen. Oxygen is carried around in the blood in the red blood cells, attached to a chemical called haemoglobin (see Chapter 5). Carbon monoxide can combine with the haemoglobin much more tightly than oxygen can, forming a compound called carboxyhaemoglobin. The haemoglobin will combine with carbon monoxide in preference to oxygen. When this happens, the blood carries much less oxygen around the body. Carbon monoxide from smoking is also a major cause of heart disease (Chapter 5).\\n\\nIf a pregnant woman smokes, she will be depriving her unborn fetus of oxygen (Figure 3.14). This has an effect on its growth and development, and leads to the mass of the baby at birth being lower, on average, than the mass of babies born to non-smokers.\\n\\n### SOME SMOKING STATISTICS',\n",

These include cancer of the lung, mouth, lip, throat, bladder, kidney, pancreas, stomach, liver and cervix.\\n- While demand for tobacco has steadily fallen in developed countries like the UK, cigarette consumption is being increasingly concentrated in the developing world.\\n- 9.6 million adults in the UK smoke cigarettes, 20% of men and 17% of women.

One method is 'vaping', which involves inhaling a vapour containing nicotine from an electronic cigarette or e-cigarette (Figure 3.15). Other methods use nicotine patches (Figure 3.16) or nicotine chewing gum. They all work in a similar way, providing the smoker with a source of nicotine without the harmful tar from cigarettes. The nicotine is absorbed by the body and reduces the craving for a cigarette. Gradually, the patient reduces the nicotine dose until they are weaned off the habit.\\n\\n### EXTENSION WORK\\n\\nYou could carry out an Internet search to find out about the different methods people use to help them give up smoking.

Meat, butter, cheese, milk, eggs and oily fish are all rich in animal fats, as well as foods fried in animal fat. Vegetable oils include many types used for cooking, such as olive oil, corn oil and rapeseed oil, as well as products made from oils, such as margarine (Figure 4.3).\\n\\nLipids make up about 10% of our body's mass. They form an essential part of the structure of all cells, and fat is deposited in certain parts of the body as a long-term store of energy, for example under the skin and around the heart and kidneys. The fat layer under the skin acts as insulation, reducing heat loss through the surface of the body. Fat around organs such as the kidneys also helps to protect them from mechanical damage.\",\n",
       "  \"The chemical 'building blocks' of lipids are two types of molecule called glycerol and fatty acids. Glycerol is an oily liquid. It is also known as glycerine, and is used in many types of cosmetics. In lipids, a molecule of glycerol is joined to three fatty acid molecules. There are many different fatty acid molecules, which give us the many different kinds of lipid found in food (Figure 4.4).\\n\\nAlthough lipids are an essential part of our diet, too much lipid is unhealthy, especially a type called saturated fat, and a lipid compound called cholesterol. These substances have been linked to heart disease (see Chapter 5).\\n\\nFigure 4.4 depicts lipids made up of a molecule of glycerol joined to three fatty acids. The many different fatty acids form the variable part of the molecule.\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\nCholesterol is a substance that the body gets from food such as eggs and meat, but we also make cholesterol in our liver. It is an essential part of all cells, but too much cholesterol causes heart disease.\",\n",
       "  \"### DID YOU KNOW?\\nSaturated lipids (saturated fats) are more common in food from animal sources, such as meat and dairy products. 'Saturated' is a word used in chemistry, which means that the fatty acids of the lipids contain no double bonds. Other lipids are unsaturated, which means that their fatty acids contain double bonds. These are more common in plant oils. There is evidence that unsaturated lipids are healthier for us than saturated ones.\\n\\n## PROTEINS\\n\\nProteins make up about 18% of the mass of the body. This is the second largest percentage after water. All cells contain protein, so we need it for growth and repair of tissues. Many compounds in the body are made from protein, including enzymes.\\n\\nMost foods contain some protein, but certain foods such as meat, fish, cheese and eggs are particularly rich in it. You will notice that these foods are animal products. Plant material generally contains less protein, but some foods, especially beans, peas and nuts, are richer in protein than others.\",\n",
       "  \"However, we don't need much protein in our diet to stay healthy. Doctors recommend a maximum daily intake of about 70g. In more economically developed countries, people often eat far more protein than they need, whereas in many poorer countries a protein-deficiency disease called kwashiorkor is common (Figure 4.5).\\n\\nFigure 4.5 shows a child suffering from a lack of protein in his diet, a disease called kwashiorkor. His swollen belly is not due to a full stomach, but is caused by fluid collecting in the tissues. Other symptoms include loss of weight, poor muscle growth, general weakness and flaky skin.\\n\\nLike starch, proteins are also polymers, but whereas starch is made from a single molecular building block (glucose), proteins are made from 20 different sub-units called amino acids. All amino acids contain four chemical elements: carbon, hydrogen and oxygen (as in carbohydrates and fats) along with nitrogen. Two amino acids also contain sulfur. The amino acids are linked together in long chains, which are usually folded up or twisted into spirals, with cross-links holding the chains together (Figure 4.6).\\n---\\nANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY | FOOD AND DIGESTION\\n\\na) [A simple diagram showing a chain of different shapes representing amino acids]\",\n",

Each shape represents a different amino acid. (b) A computer model of the protein insulin. This substance, like all proteins, is made of a long chain of amino acids arranged in a particular order and folded into a specific shape.\\n\\nThe shape of a protein is very important in allowing it to carry out its function, and the order of amino acids in the protein decides its shape. Because there are 20 different amino acids, and they can be arranged in any order, the number of different protein structures that can be made is enormous. As a result, there are thousands of different kinds of proteins in organisms, from structural proteins such as collagen and keratin in skin and nails, to proteins with more specific functions, such as enzymes and haemoglobin.\\n\\n## EXTENSION WORK',\n",
       "  \"## EXTENSION WORK\\n\\nHumans can make about half of the 20 amino acids that they need, but the other 10 have to be taken in as part of the diet. These 10 are called essential amino acids. There are higher amounts of essential amino acids in meat, fish, eggs and dairy products. If you are a vegetarian, you can still get all the essential amino acids you need, as long as you eat a varied diet that includes a range of different plant materials.\\n\\n## MINERALS\\n\\nAll the foods you have read about so far are made from just five chemical elements: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur. Our bodies contain many other elements that we get from our food as 'minerals' or 'mineral ions'. Some are present in large amounts in the body, for example calcium, which is used for making teeth and bones. Others are present in much smaller amounts, but still have essential jobs to do. For instance our bodies contain about 3g of iron, but without it our blood would not be able to carry oxygen. Table 4.1 shows just a few of these minerals and the reasons they are needed.\\n\\nTable 4.1 Some examples of minerals needed by the body:\",\n",

For example, a one-year-old child needs to consume about 0.6g (600 mg) of calcium every day, to make the bones grow properly and harden. Anything less than this over a prolonged period could result in poor bone development. The bones become deformed, a disease called rickets (Figure 4.7). Rickets can also be caused by lack of vitamin D in the diet (see below).\",\n",
       "  \"Similarly, 16-year-olds need about 12 mg of iron in their daily food intake. If they don't get this amount, they can't make enough haemoglobin for their red blood cells (see Chapter 5). This causes a condition called anaemia. People who are anaemic become tired and lack energy, because their blood doesn't carry enough oxygen.\\n\\nFigure 4.7 An x-ray of the legs of a child showing the symptoms of rickets.\\n\\n## VITAMINS\\n\\nDuring the early part of the twentieth century, experiments were carried out that identified another class of food substances. When young laboratory rats were fed a diet of pure carbohydrate, lipid and protein, they all became ill and died. If they were fed on the same pure foods with a little added milk, they grew normally. The milk contained chemicals that the rats needed in small amounts to stay healthy. These chemicals are called vitamins. The results of one of these experiments are shown in Figure 4.8.\",\n",

Vitamins in the milk had a dramatic effect on their growth.\\n\\nAt first, the chemical nature of vitamins was not known, and they were given letters to distinguish between them, such as vitamin A, vitamin B and so on. Each was identified by the effect a lack of the vitamin (vitamin deficiency) had on the body. For example, vitamin D is needed for growing bones to take up calcium salts. A deficiency of this vitamin can result in rickets (Figure 4.7), just as a lack of calcium can.',\n",

These are made by the pancreas, and digest starch, proteins and lipids (Table 4.5). As well as this, the liver makes a digestive juice called bile. Bile is a green liquid that is stored in the gall bladder and passes down the bile duct on to the food. Bile does not contain enzymes, but has another important function. It turns any large lipid globules in the food into an emulsion of tiny droplets (Figure 4.16). This increases the surface area of the lipid, so that lipase enzymes can break it down more easily.',\n",
       "  'Bile and pancreatic juice have another function. They are both alkaline. The mixture of semi-digested food and enzymes coming from the stomach is acidic, and needs to be neutralised by the addition of alkali before it continues on its way through the gut.\\n\\nAs the food continues along the intestine, more enzymes are added, until the parts of the food that can be digested have been fully broken down into soluble end products, which can be absorbed. This is the role of the last part of the small intestine, the ileum.\\n\\nFigure 4.16 Bile turns fats into an emulsion of tiny droplets for easier digestion.\\n\\n## ABSORPTION IN THE ILEUM\\n\\nThe ileum is highly adapted to absorb the digested food. The lining of the ileum has a very large surface area, which means that it can quickly and efficiently absorb the soluble products of digestion into the blood. The length of the intestine helps to provide a large surface area, and this is aided by folds in its lining, but the greatest increase in area is due to tiny projections from the lining, called villi (Figure 4.17).',\n",
       "  \"Figure 4.17 (a) The inside lining of the ileum is adapted to absorb digested food by the presence of millions of tiny villi. (b) Photo of the inside a patient's ileum, taken using a camera attached to an endoscope. You can see thousands of tiny villi covering the lining.\\n\\nThe singular of villi is 'villus'. Each villus is only about 1-2 mm long, but there are millions of them, so that the total area of the lining is thought to be about 300 m². This provides a massive area in contact with the digested food. As well as this, high-powered microscopy has revealed that the surface cells of each villus themselves have hundreds of minute projections, called microvilli, which increase the surface area for absorption even more (Figure 4.18).\\n\\nEach villus contains a network of blood capillaries. Most of the digested food enters these blood vessels, but the products of fat digestion, as well as tiny fat droplets, enter a tube in the middle of the villus, called a lacteal. The lacteals form part of the body's lymphatic system, which transports a liquid called lymph. This lymph eventually drains into the blood system too.\\n---\\nANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY                         FOOD AND DIGESTION                                                              61\\n\\nDiagram of a villus structure\",\n",

This means that there is only a short distance between the digested food in the ileum and the blood capillaries making it easier for the products of digestion to diffuse through and enter the blood. The epithelium cells contain many mitochondria, which supply the energy needed for active transport of some substances.\\n\\nIn addition each villus contains muscle fibres which contract to move the villus. The villi are in constant motion, keeping them in contact with the contents of the ileum and maintaining a steep concentration gradient for diffusion of the products of digestion.',\n",
       "  'The blood vessels from the ileum join up to form a large blood vessel called the hepatic portal vein, which leads to the liver (see Chapter 5). The liver acts rather like a food processing factory, breaking some molecules down, and building up and storing others. For example, glucose from carbohydrate digestion is converted into glycogen and stored in the liver. Later, the glycogen can be converted back into glucose when the body needs it (see Chapter 7).\\n\\nThe digested food molecules are distributed around the body by the blood system (see Chapter 5). The soluble food molecules are absorbed from the blood into cells of tissues, and are used to build new parts of cells. This is called assimilation.\\n\\n## KEY POINT\\n\\nRemoval of faeces by the body is sometimes incorrectly called excretion. Excretion is a word that only applies to materials that are the waste products of cells of the body, such as carbon dioxide. Faeces are not products of cell metabolism - they consist of waste that has passed through the gut and left the body via the anus, without entering the cells.

The function of the first part of the large intestine, called the colon, is to absorb most of the remaining water from the contents, leaving a semi-solid waste material called faeces.

Materials can easily move around the cell without a special system. There is no need for lungs or gills to obtain oxygen from the environment either. Single-celled organisms obtain oxygen by diffusion through the surface membrane of the cell. The rest of the cell then uses the oxygen. The area of the cell's surface determines how much oxygen the organism can get (the supply rate), and the volume of the cell determines how much oxygen the organism uses (the demand rate).\\n\\noxygenated\\nblood\\n\\ndeoxygenated\\nblood\\n\\nThe ratio of supply to demand can be written as: surface area\\nvolume\\n\\n▲ Figure 5.1 The human circulatory system.\\n\\nThis is called the 'surface area to volume ratio' and it is affected by the size of an organism (see Chapter 1, Activity 4). Single-celled organisms have a high surface area to volume ratio. Their cell surface membrane has a large enough area to supply all the oxygen that their volume demands. In larger animals, the surface area to volume ratio is lower.\",\n",
       "  \"Large animals cannot get all the oxygen they need through their surface (even if the body surface would allow it to pass through) – there just isn't enough surface to supply all that volume. To overcome this problem, large organisms have evolved special gas exchange organs and circulatory systems. The gills of fish and the lungs of mammals are linked to a circulatory system that carries oxygen to all parts of the body. The same idea applies to obtaining nutrients – the gut obtains nutrients from food and the circulatory system distributes the nutrients around the body.\\n\\n## THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS OF DIFFERENT ANIMALS\\n\\nOne of the main functions of a circulatory system in animals is to transport oxygen. Blood is pumped to a gas exchange organ to load oxygen. It is then pumped to other parts of the body where it unloads the oxygen. There are two main types of circulatory systems in animals.\\n\\n■ In a single circulatory system the blood is pumped from the heart to the gas exchange organ and then directly to the rest of the body.\\n\\n■ In a double circulatory system the blood is pumped from the heart to the gas exchange organ, back to the heart and then to the rest of the body.\",\n",

Deoxygenated blood leaves the heart through the pulmonary arteries, and is circulated through the lungs, where it becomes oxygenated. The oxygenated blood returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins.\\n\\n- The systemic circulation.

This can cut off the blood supply to an area of cardiac muscle. The affected muscle can no longer receive oxygen and glucose, so it cannot respire and release energy. This means it is unable to contract, resulting in a heart attack. This is called coronary heart disease (CHD). It can lead to severe health problems and is often fatal.\\n\\n[A diagram of a heart showing coronary arteries, a blocked coronary artery, and a region deprived of oxygen]\\n\\nFigure 5.7 A blockage of a coronary artery cuts off the blood supply to part of the heart muscle.\\n\\nA number of factors make coronary heart disease more likely:\\n\\n- heredity – some people inherit a tendency to develop coronary heart disease\\n- high blood pressure – puts more strain on the heart\\n- diet – eating large amounts of saturated fat is likely to raise cholesterol levels\\n- smoking – raises blood pressure and makes blood clots more likely to form\\n- stress – raises blood pressure\\n- lack of exercise – regular exercise helps to reduce blood pressure and strengthens the heart.\\n\\n## HEART RATE',\n",
       "  \"## HEART RATE\\n\\nNormally the heart beats about 70 times a minute, but this can change according to the needs of the body. When we exercise, muscles must release more energy. They need an increased supply of oxygen for aerobic respiration (see Chapter 1). To deliver the extra oxygen, both the number of beats per minute (heart rate) and the volume of blood pumped with each beat (called stroke volume) increase.\\n\\nWhen we are angry or afraid our heart rate again increases. The increased output supplies extra blood to the muscles, enabling them to release extra energy through aerobic respiration. This allows us to fight or run away and is called the 'fight or flight' response. It is triggered by secretion of the hormone adrenaline from the adrenal glands (see Chapter 7).\\n\\nWhen we sleep, our heart rate decreases as all our organs are working more slowly.

Substances are transferred between the blood in the capillary and the cells.

Figure 5.11 shows the structure of a capillary and how exchange of substances takes place between the capillary and nearby cells. The walls of capillaries are one cell thick, providing a short distance for diffusion of materials into and out of the blood. Red blood cells just fit through the tiny diameter of capillaries, so they are close to the capillary wall. This means that there is a short distance for oxygen to diffuse.

       "  '## RED BLOOD CELLS\\n\\nThe red blood cells or erythrocytes are highly specialised cells made in the bone marrow. They have a limited life span of about 100 days after which time they are destroyed in the spleen. They have only one function – to transport oxygen. Several features enable them to carry out this function very efficiently.\\n\\nRed blood cells contain haemoglobin. This is an iron-containing protein that associates (combines) with oxygen to form oxyhaemoglobin when there is a high concentration of oxygen in the surroundings. We say that the red blood cell is loading oxygen. When the concentration of oxygen is low, oxyhaemoglobin turns back into haemoglobin and the red blood cell unloads its oxygen.\\n\\nAs red blood cells pass through the lungs, they load oxygen. As they pass through active tissues they unload oxygen.\\n\\n| haemoglobin + oxygen | in the lungs → | oxyhaemoglobin |\\n|----------------------|----------------|-----------------|\\n|                      | in the tissues ← |                 |',\n",

It is lost during their development in the bone marrow. This means that more haemoglobin can be packed into each red blood cell so more oxygen can be transported. Their biconcave shape allows efficient exchange of oxygen in and out of the cell. Each red blood cell has a high surface area to volume ratio, giving a large area for diffusion. The thin shape of the cell results in a short diffusion distance to the centre of the cell.\\n\\n## WHITE BLOOD CELLS\\n\\nThere are several types of white blood cell. Their main role is to protect the body against invasion by disease-causing microorganisms (pathogens), such as bacteria and viruses. They do this in two main ways: phagocytosis and production of antibodies.',\n",
       "  \"About 70% of white blood cells can ingest (take in) microorganisms such as bacteria. This is called phagocytosis, and the cells are phagocytes. They do this by changing their shape, producing extensions of their cytoplasm, called pseudopodia. The pseudopodia surround and enclose the microorganism in a vacuole. Once it is inside, the phagocyte secretes enzymes into the vacuole to break the microorganism down (Figure 5.14). Phagocytosis means 'cell eating' – you can see why it is called this.\\n\\nApproximately 25% of white blood cells are lymphocytes. Their function is to make chemicals called antibodies. Antibodies are soluble proteins that pass into the plasma. Pathogens such as bacteria and viruses have chemical 'markers' on their surfaces, which the antibodies recognise. These markers are called antigens. The antibodies stick to the surface antigens and destroy the pathogen. They do this in a number of ways, for example by:\\n\\n- causing bacteria to stick together, so that phagocytes can ingest them more easily\\n- acting as a 'label' on the pathogen, so that it is more easily recognised by a phagocyte\\n- causing bacterial cells to burst open\\n- neutralising poisons (toxins) produced by pathogens.\",\n",

The surroundings outside the body are called the external environment. A stimulus is a change in an animal's surroundings; and a response is a reaction to that change.

Glands secrete (release) chemical substances, and they are the second type of effector organ. Again, the link between the stimulus and the response is the nervous system. The information in the nerve cells is transmitted in the form of tiny electrical signals called nerve impulses.\\n---\\n# 78 ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY\\n\\n# COORDINATION\\n\\n# DID YOU KNOW?\\n\\nSome animals can detect changes in their environment that are not sensed by humans. Insects such as bees can see ultraviolet (UV) light: The wavelengths of UV are invisible to humans.\\n\\nFigure 6.1 This yellow flower (a) looks very different to a bee, which sees patterns on the petals reflecting UV light (b).\\n\\n# RECEPTORS\\n\\nThe role of any receptor is to detect the stimulus by changing its energy into the electrical energy of the nerve impulses. For example; the eye converts light energy into nerve impulses, and the ear converts sound energy into nerve impulses (Table 6.1).',\n",
       "  \"|Receptor|Type of energy received|\\n|---|---|\\n|eye (retina)|light|\\n|ear (organ of hearing)|sound|\\n|ear (organ of balance)|mechanical (kinetic)|\\n|tongue (taste buds)|chemical|\\n|nose (organ of smell)|chemical|\\n|skin (touch/pressure/pain receptors)|mechanical (kinetic)|\\n|skin (temperature receptors)|heat|\\n|muscle (stretch receptors)|mechanical (kinetic)|\\n\\nNotice how a 'sense' like touch is made up of several components. When we touch a warm surface we will be stimulating several types of receptor; including touch and temperature receptors, as well as stretch receptors in the muscles (see the section on skin in Chapter 8). As well as this, each sense detects different aspects of the energy it receives. For example, the ears don't just detect sounds, but different loudness and frequencies of sound, while the eye not only forms an image, but also detects brightness of light and in humans can tell the difference between different light wavelengths (colours).\\n\\nSome organisms can even detect the direction of magnetic fields: Many birds; such as pigeons; have a built-in compass in their brain; which they use for navigation. A species of bacterium can also do this; but as yet no one can explain why this might be an advantage to it.\\n\\n# THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM\",\n",
       "  \"# THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM\\n\\nThe biological name for a nerve cell is a neurone. The impulses that travel along a neurone are not an electric current; as in a wire. They are caused by movements of charged particles (ions) in and out of the neurone. Impulses travel at speeds between about 10 and 100 metres per second, which is much slower than an electric current; but fast enough to produce a rapid response.\\n\\nImpulses from receptors pass along nerves containing sensory neurones until they reach the brain and spinal cord. These two organs are together known as the central nervous system, or CNS. Other nerves contain motor neurones, transmitting impulses to the muscles and glands. Some nerves contain only sensory or motor cells, while other nerves contain both; they are 'mixed'. A typical nerve contains thousands of individual neurones.\\n---\\n# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY\\n\\n# COORDINATION\\n\\nDID YOU KNOW?\\n\\nThe CNS is well protected by the skeleton: The brain is inside the skull or cranium (nerves connected to the brain are cranial nerves) and the spinal cord runs down the middle of the spinal column; passing through a hole in each vertebra. Nerves connected to the spinal cord are called spinal nerves:\\n\\n# THE STRUCTURE OF NEURONES\",\n",
       "  '# THE STRUCTURE OF NEURONES\\n\\nBoth sensory and motor neurones can be very long: For example; a motor neurone leading from the CNS to the muscles in the finger has a fibre about a metre in length, which is 100 000 times the length of the cell body (Figure 6.3).\\n\\nThe cell body of a motor neurone is at one end of the fibre; in the CNS The cell body has fine cytoplasmic extensions, called dendrons. These in turn form finer extensions, called dendrites. There can be junctions with other neurones on any part of the cell body, dendrons or dendrites. These junctions are called synapses. Later in this chapter we will deal with the importance of synapses in nerve pathways.\\n\\nOne of the extensions from the motor neurone cell body is much longer than the other dendrons. This is the fibre that carries impulses to the effector organ, and is called the axon. At the end of the axon furthest from the cell body; it divides into many nerve endings: These fine branches of the axon connect with a muscle at a special sort of synapse called a neuromuscular junction. In this way impulses are carried from the CNS out to the muscle. The signals from nerve impulses are transmitted across the neuromuscular junction, causing the muscle fibres to contract.',\n",
       "  \"The axon is covered by a sheath made of a fatty material called myelin: The myelin sheath insulates the axon; preventing 'short circuits' with other axons; and also speeds up the conduction of the impulses.

The fibre from the sensory receptor to the cell body is actually a dendron; while the fibre from the cell body to the CNS is a short axon. As with motor neurones, fibres of sensory neurones are often myelinated:\\n\\n# THE EYE\",\n",
       "  \"# THE EYE\\n\\nMany animals have eyes, but few show the complexity of the human eye. Simpler animals, such as snails, use their eyes to detect light but cannot form proper images. Other animals, such as dogs, can form images but cannot distinguish colours. The human eye does all three. Of course, it is not really the eye that 'sees' anything at all, but the brain that interprets the impulses from the eye. To find out how light from an object is converted into impulses representing an image, we need to look at the structure of this complex organ (Figure 6.4).\\n\\nThe tough outer coat of the eye is called the sclera, which is the visible white part of the eye. At the front of the eye, the sclera becomes a transparent 'window' called the cornea, which lets light into the eye. Behind the cornea is the coloured ring of tissue called the iris. In the middle of the iris is a hole called the pupil, which lets the light through: It is black because there is no light escaping from the inside of the eye.\\n---\\n# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY\\n\\n# COORDINATION\\n\\nFigure 6.4 A horizontal section through the human eye\\n\\n|ciliary muscles|retina|\\n|---|---|\\n|iris|lens|\\n|pupil|cornea|\\n|conjunctiva|suspensory ligaments|\\n|choroid|sclera|\\n|blind spot|optic nerve|\",\n",

Underneath the sclera is a dark layer called the choroid. It is dark because it contains many pigment cells, as well as blood vessels. The pigment stops light being reflected around inside the eye.\\n\\nThe fact that the inverted image is seen the right way up by the brain makes the point that it is the brain which 'sees' things, not the eye. An interesting experiment was carried out to test this: Volunteers were made to wear special inverting goggles for long periods. These turned the view of their surroundings upside down. At first this completely disorientated them; and they found it difficult to make even simple coordinated movements. However, after a while their brains adapted, until the view through the goggles looked normal: In fact, when the volunteers removed the goggles; the world then looked upside down!\",\n",
       "  'To form an image on the retina, light needs to be bent or refracted: Refraction takes place when light passes from one medium to another of a different density: In the eye, this happens first at the air/cornea boundary; and again at the lens (Figure 6.5). In fact the cornea acts as the first lens of the eye.',\n",
       "  \"The innermost layer of the back of the eye is the retina: This is the light-sensitive layer; the place where light energy is converted into the electrical energy of nerve impulses. The retina contains receptor cells called rods and cones. These cells react to light; producing impulses in sensory neurones. The sensory neurones then pass the impulses to the brain through the optic nerve. Rod cells work well in dim light; but they cannot distinguish between different colours; so the brain sees an image produced by the rods in black and white. This is why we can't see colours very well in dim light: only our rods are working properly. The cones on the other hand; will only work in bright light, and there are three types which respond to different wavelengths or colours of light: red, green and blue. We can see all the colours of visible light as a result of these three types of cones being stimulated to different degrees. For example, if red, green and blue are stimulated equally, we see white. Both rods and cones are found throughout the retina; but cones are particularly concentrated at the centre of the retina, in an area called the fovea. Cones give a sharper image than rods, which is why we can only see objects clearly if we are looking directly at them, so that the image falls\",\n",

The iris contains two types of muscles: Circular muscles form a ring shape in the iris, and radial muscles lie like the spokes of a wheel. In bright light, the pupil is constricted (made smaller): This happens because the circular muscles contract and the radial muscles relax. In dim light, the opposite happens: The radial muscles contract and the circular muscles relax, dilating (widening) the pupil.\\n\\nFigure 6.6 The amount of light entering the eye is controlled by the iris, which alters the diameter of the pupil.\\n\\n| |bright light|dim light|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|circular muscles|contract|relax|\\n|radial muscles|relax|contract|\\n|pupil|constricts|dilates|\\n---\\n# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY\\n\\n# COORDINATION\\n\\n# KEY POINT',\n",

At this position there are no rods or cones, so it is called the blind spot. The retina of each eye has a blind spot; but they are not a problem, because the brain puts the images from each eye together; cancelling out the blind spots of both eyes. As well as this, the optic nerve leaves the eye towards the edge of the retina, where vision is not very sharp anyway: To 'see' your own blind spot you can do a simple experiment: Cover or close your right eye. Hold this page about 30 cm from your eyes and look at the black dot below: Now; without moving the book or turning your head, read the numbers from left to right by moving your left eye slowly towards the right:\\n\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15\\n\\nYou should find that when the image of the dot falls on the blind spot it disappears.

In the eye, a different method is used. Rather than altering its position, the shape of the lens can be changed: A lens that is fatter in the middle (more convex) will refract light rays more than a thinner (less convex) lens.

       "  \"When we focus on a nearby object; for example when reading a book; the light rays from the object are spreading out (diverging) when they enter the eye (Figure 6.7(b)). In this situation, the lens has to be more convex in order to refract the rays enough to focus them on the retina. The ciliary muscles now contract; the suspensory ligaments become slack and the elastic lens bulges outwards into a more convex shape.\\n\\n# REFLEX ACTIONS\\n\\n|stimulus|receptor|CNS|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|sensory neurone|relay neurone|response|\\n|motor neurone|effector| |\\n\\nYou saw on page 82 that the dilation and constriction of the pupil by the iris is an example of a reflex action. You now need to understand a little more about the nerves involved in a reflex. The nerve pathway of a reflex is called the reflex arc. The 'arc' part means that the pathway goes into the CNS and then straight back out again; in a sort of curve or arc (Figure 6.8).\\n\\nFigure 6.8 Simplified diagram of a reflex arc\\n---\\n# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY\\n\\n# COORDINATION\",\n",
       "  'Figure 6.8 Simplified diagram of a reflex arc\\n---\\n# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY\\n\\n# COORDINATION\\n\\nThe iris-pupil reflex protects the eye against damage by bright light. Other reflexes are protective too, preventing serious harm to the body. Take, for example, the reflex response to a painful stimulus. This happens when part of your body, such as your hand, touches a sharp or hot object. The reflex results in your hand being quickly withdrawn. Figure 6.9 shows the nerve pathway of this reflex in more detail.\\n\\nFigure 6.9 A reflex arc in more detail\\n\\nKEY POINT\\n\\nThe stimulus is detected by temperature or pain receptors in the skin. These generate impulses in sensory neurones. The impulses enter the CNS through a part of the spinal nerve called the dorsal root. In the spinal cord, the sensory neurones connect by synapses with short relay neurones, which in turn connect with motor neurones. The motor neurones emerge from the spinal cord through the ventral root, and send impulses back out to the muscles of the arm. These muscles then contract, pulling the arm (and thus finger) away from the harmful stimulus.\\n\\nDID YOU KNOW?',\n",
       "  \"DID YOU KNOW?\\n\\nThe middle part of the spinal cord consists mainly of nerve cell bodies, which gives it a grey colour. This is why it is known as grey matter. The outer part of the spinal cord is called white matter, and has a whiter appearance because it contains many axons with their fatty myelin sheaths. (In the brain this is reversed; the grey matter is on the outside and the white matter in the middle of the brain.)\\n\\nImpulses travel through the reflex arc in a fraction of a second, so that the reflex action is very fast and doesn't need to be started by impulses from the brain. However, this doesn't mean that the brain is unaware of what is going on. This is because in the spinal cord, the reflex arc neurones also form connections called synapses with nerve cells leading to and from the brain. The brain therefore receives information about the stimulus. This is how we feel the pain.\\n\\nMovements are sometimes a result of reflex actions, but we can also contract our muscles as a voluntary action, using nerve cell pathways from the brain linked to the same motor neurones. Voluntary action is under conscious control.\\n---\\n# 86 ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY\\n\\n# COORDINATION\\n\\n# SYNAPSES\",\n",
       "  \"# COORDINATION\\n\\n# SYNAPSES\\n\\nSynapses are critical to the working of the nervous system: The CNS is made of many billions of nerve cells, and these have links with many others, through synapses: In the brain; each neurone may form synapses with thousands of other neurones. It is estimated that there are between 100 and 1000 million million synapses in the CNS. Since impulses can take different routes through these, there is an almost infinite number of possible pathways through the system.\\n\\nA synapse is actually a gap between two nerve cells. The gap is not crossed by the electrical impulses passing through the neurones, but by chemicals. Impulses arriving at a synapse cause the ends of the fine branches of the axon to secrete a chemical, called a neurotransmitter. This chemical diffuses across the gap and attaches to the membrane of the second neurone. It then starts off impulses in the second cell (Figure 6.10). After the neurotransmitter has 'passed on the message', it is broken down by an enzyme.\\n\\n|synaptic connections with|impulses arrive down axon|neurotransmitter|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|other neurones|of first neurone|diffuses across|\\n| |membrane of|second neurone|\\n|impulse started in|second neurone|neurotransmitter broken|\\n|axon| |down by enzyme from|\",\n",

       "  \"# COORDINATION\\n\\n# LOOKING AHEAD\\n\\n# WHAT IS A NERVE IMPULSE?\\n\\nA nerve impulse is an electrical signal that travels along the axon of a nerve cell. When the cell is not transmitting an impulse, there is a small potential difference (voltage) across the nerve cell membrane. The potential inside the axon is about -70 mV lower than outside. This 'resting potential' is caused by differences in concentrations of various ions inside and outside the cell. When the cell is stimulated, sodium ions (Na+) rush into the axon through the membrane. The inflow of positively charged ions causes the potential to become positive; we say that it is depolarised. This sudden switch in voltage is called an 'action potential'. It only lasts for a few milliseconds (Figure 6.12). After a brief 'overshoot' below -70 mV, it returns to normal (repolarised), as other positive ions (potassium, K+) pass out through the membrane.\\n\\n# Action potential\\n\\n|+30|HL|1|0|8|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|-70|g|resting potential| | |\\n|time / ms| | | | |\\n\\nFigure 6.12 Nerve cell action potential.\",\n",

The action potential stimulates the next part of the cell membrane; so that the depolarisation spreads along the axon. After the action potential has passed, ion exchange pumps in the membrane sort out the imbalance of Na+ and K+ ions. The pumps use ATP for active transport; this is one reason why nerve cells need a lot of metabolic energy from respiration.\\n\\nNerve cells are called 'excitable cells' because they can change their membrane potential in this way. Other excitable cells include muscle and receptor cells.

This means that cells in the gland make a chemical which leaves the cells through the cell membrane. The chemical then travels somewhere else in the body, where it carries out its function. There are two types of glands: exocrine and endocrine glands. Exocrine glands secrete their products through a tube called a duct. For example, salivary glands in your mouth secrete saliva down salivary ducts and tear glands secrete tears through ducts that lead to the surface of the eye.',\n",

The sex organs of males (testes) and females (ovaries) are also endocrine organs. In addition to their role in producing sex cells, the testes and ovaries make hormones that are involved in controlling reproduction. This topic is covered more fully in Chapter 9.

In animals other than humans this action usually means dealing with an attack by an enemy, where the animal can stay and fight or run away hence 'fight or flight'.

Glycogen is made from long chains of glucose sub-units joined together; forming a large insoluble molecule (see Chapter 4). Being insoluble makes glycogen a good storage product. When the body is short of glucose; the glycogen can be broken down into glucose, which then passes into the bloodstream:\\n\\nAdrenaline raises blood glucose concentration in an emergency, but other hormones act all the time to control the level, keeping it fairly constant at a little less than 1 g of glucose in every dm3 (cubic decimetre) of blood. The main hormone controlling glucose is insulin. Insulin is made by special cells in the pancreas. It stimulates the liver cells to take up glucose and convert it into glycogen; lowering the level of glucose in the blood:\\n\\n# DID YOU KNOW?',\n",
       "  '# DID YOU KNOW?\\n\\nThe concentration of glucose in your blood will start to rise after you have had a meal: Sugars from digested carbohydrate pass into the blood and are carried to the liver in the hepatic portal vein (Chapter 5). In the liver the glucose is converted to glycogen; so the blood leaving the liver in the hepatic vein has a lower concentration of glucose than when it enters the liver:\\n\\n# DIABETES\\n\\nSome people have a disease where their pancreas cannot make enough insulin to keep their blood glucose level constant; it rises to very high concentrations. The disease is called diabetes. One symptom of diabetes can be detected by a chemical test on urine: Normally, people have no glucose at all in their urine. Someone suffering from diabetes may have such a high concentration of glucose in the blood that it is excreted in their urine. This can be shown up by using coloured test strips (Figure 7.5).\\n\\n# KEY POINT',\n",

At first the pancreas makes extra insulin, but eventually it can't continue to make enough to maintain blood glucose at a normal level. Type 2 diabetes is common in people who are overweight and eat a poor diet that is high in sugar and other carbohydrates.

One aspect of homeostasis is the maintenance of the water and salt content of the internal environment. This is called osmoregulation. |\\n\\nIf you were to drink a litre of water and wait for half an hour, your body would soon respond to this change by producing about the same volume of urine. In other words, it would automatically balance your water input and water loss. Drinking is the main way that our bodies gain water, but there are other sources (Figure 8.1). Some water is present in the food that we eat, and a small amount is formed by cell respiration. The body also loses water, mostly in urine, but also smaller volumes in sweat, faeces and exhaled air. Every day, we gain and lose about the same volume of water, so that the total content of our bodies stays more or less the same. This is an example of homeostasis. The word 'homeostasis' means 'steady state', and refers to keeping conditions inside the body relatively constant.\",\n",

       "  \"It is not just water and salts that are kept constant in the body. Many other components of the internal environment are maintained. For example, the level of carbon dioxide in the blood is regulated, along with the blood pH, the concentration of dissolved glucose (see Chapter 7) and the body temperature.\\n\\nHomeostasis is important because cells will only function properly if they are bathed in a tissue fluid which provides them with their optimum conditions. For instance, if the tissue fluid contains too many solutes, the cells will lose water by osmosis, and become dehydrated. If the tissue fluid is too dilute, the cells will swell up with water. Both conditions will prevent them working efficiently and might cause permanent damage. If the pH of the tissue fluid is not correct, it will affect the activity of the cell's enzymes, as will a body temperature much different from 37 °C. It is also important that excretory products are removed. Substances such as urea must be prevented from building up in the blood and tissue fluid, where they would be toxic to cells.\",\n",
       "  \"### DID YOU KNOW?\\n'Salts' in urine or in the blood are present as ions. For example, the sodium chloride in Table 8.1 will be in solution as sodium ions (Na+) and chloride ions (Cl-). Urine contains many other ions, such as potassium (K+), phosphate (HPO₄²⁻) and ammonium (NH₄+), and removes excess ions from the blood.\\n\\n## URINE\\n\\nAn adult human produces about 1.5 dm³ of urine every day, although this volume depends very much on the amount of water drunk and the volume lost in other forms, such as sweat. Every litre of urine contains about 40g of waste products and salts (Table 8.1).\\n\\n---\\nMARKDOWN_EXTRACTION_FAILED\\n---\\nThe real difference between homeotherms and all other animals is that homeotherms can keep their temperatures constant by using physiological changes for generating or losing heat. For this reason, mammals and birds are also called 'endotherms', meaning 'heat from inside'.\\n\\nAn endotherm uses heat from the chemical reactions in its cells to warm its body. It then controls its heat loss by regulating processes like sweating and blood flow through the skin. Endotherms use behavioural ways to control their temperature too. For example, penguins 'huddle' together in groups to keep warm, and humans put on extra clothes in winter.\",\n",
       "  \"What is the advantage of a human maintaining a body temperature of 37°C? It means that all the chemical reactions taking place in the cells of the body can go on at a steady, predictable rate. The metabolism doesn't slow down in cold environments. If you watch goldfish in a garden pond, you will notice that in summer, when the pond water is warm, they are very active, swimming about quickly. In winter, when the temperature drops, the fish slow down and become very sluggish in their actions. This would happen to a mammal too, if its body temperature varied.\\n\\nIt is also important that the body does not become too hot. The cells' enzymes work best at 37°C. At higher temperatures enzymes, like all proteins, are destroyed by denaturing (see Chapter 1). Endotherms have all evolved a body temperature of around 40°C (Table 8.2) and enzymes that work best at this temperature.\\n\\nTable 8.2 The body temperatures of a range of mammals and birds\",\n",

       "  '# 9 REPRODUCTION IN HUMANS\\n\\nOne of the characteristics of living organisms that makes them different from non-living things is their ability to produce offspring, or reproduce. Reproduction is all about an organism passing on its genes. This can be through special sex cells, or gametes. It can also be asexually, without the production of gametes. In this chapter we look at the differences between sexual and asexual reproduction, and study in detail the process of human reproduction.\\n\\n## LEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n- Understand the differences between sexual and asexual reproduction\\n- Understand that fertilisation involves the fusion of a male and female gamete to produce a zygote\\n- Understand that a zygote undergoes cell division and develops into an embryo\\n- Understand how the structure and function of the human male and female reproductive systems are adapted for their functions\\n- Describe the role of the placenta in the nutrition of the developing embryo\\n- Understand how the developing embryo is protected by amniotic fluid\\n- Understand the roles of oestrogen and testosterone in the development of secondary sexual characteristics\\n- Understand the roles of oestrogen and progesterone in the menstrual cycle\\n\\n## SEXUAL AND ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION COMPARED',\n",
       "  '## SEXUAL AND ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION COMPARED\\n\\nIn any method of reproduction, the end result is the production of more organisms of the same species. Humans produce more humans, pea plants produce more pea plants and salmonella bacteria produce more salmonella bacteria. However, the way in which they reproduce differs. There are two types of reproduction: sexual reproduction and asexual reproduction.\\n\\nIn sexual reproduction, specialised sex cells called gametes are produced. There are usually two types, a mobile male gamete called a sperm and a stationary female gamete called an egg cell or ovum (plural ova).\\n\\nThe sperm must move to the egg and fuse (join) with it. This is called fertilisation (Figure 9.1). The single cell formed by fertilisation is called a zygote. This cell will divide many times by mitosis to form all the cells of the new animal.',\n",
       "  \"In asexual reproduction, there are no specialised gametes and there is no fertilisation. Instead, cells in one part of the body divide by mitosis to form a structure that breaks away from the parent body and grows into a new organism. Not many animals reproduce in this way. Figure 9.2 shows Hydra (a small animal similar to jellyfish) reproducing by budding. Cells in the body wall divide to form a small version of the adult. This eventually breaks off and becomes a free-living Hydra. One animal may produce several 'buds' in a short space of time.\\n\\n**KEY POINT**\\nIndividuals produced asexually from the same adult organism are called clones.\\n---\\n# ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: REPRODUCTION IN HUMANS\\n\\n## KEY POINT\\n\\nA gene is a section of DNA that determines a particular characteristic or feature. Genes are found in the nucleus of a cell on the chromosomes (see Chapter 18).\",\n",
       "  '## KEY POINT\\n\\nA gene is a section of DNA that determines a particular characteristic or feature. Genes are found in the nucleus of a cell on the chromosomes (see Chapter 18).\\n\\nAll the offspring produced from Hydra buds are genetically identical – they have exactly the same genes. This is because all the cells of the new individual are produced by mitosis from just one cell in the body of the adult. When cells divide by mitosis, the new cells that are produced are exact copies of the original cell (see Chapter 17 for a description of mitosis). As a result, all the cells of an organism that are produced asexually have the same genes as the cell that produced them – the original adult cell. So all asexually produced offspring from one adult will have the same genes as the cells of the adult. They will all be genetic copies of that adult and so will be identical to each other.',\n",
       "  'Asexual reproduction is useful to a species when the environment in which it lives is relatively stable. If an organism is well adapted to this stable environment, asexual reproduction will produce offspring that are also well adapted. However, if the environment changes significantly, then all the individuals will be affected equally by the change. It may be such a dramatic change that none of the individuals are adapted well enough to survive. The species will die out in that area.\\n\\n## SEXUAL REPRODUCTION\\n\\nThere are four stages in any method of sexual reproduction:\\n\\n- Gametes (sperm and egg cells) are produced.\\n- The male gamete (sperm) is transferred to the female gamete (egg cell).\\n- Fertilisation must occur – the sperm fuses with the egg.\\n- The zygote formed develops into a new individual.\\n\\nThe offspring produced by sexual reproduction show a great deal of genetic variation as a result of both gamete production and fertilisation.\\n\\n## PRODUCTION OF GAMETES',\n",
       "  'The offspring produced by sexual reproduction show a great deal of genetic variation as a result of both gamete production and fertilisation.\\n\\n## PRODUCTION OF GAMETES\\n\\nSperm are produced in the male sex organs – the testes. Eggs are produced in the female sex organs – the ovaries. Both are produced when cells inside these organs divide. These cells do not divide by mitosis but by meiosis (see Chapter 17). Meiosis produces cells that are not genetically identical and have only half the number of chromosomes as the original cell.\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\n\\nCells that have the full number of chromosomes are called diploid cells. Cells that only have half the normal number of chromosomes are called haploid cells.\\n\\n## TRANSFER OF THE SPERM TO THE EGG\\n\\nSperm are specialised for swimming.

The female animals release their eggs into the water and the sperm then swim through the water to fertilise the eggs. This is called external fertilisation as it takes place outside the body. Before the release takes place, there is usually some mating behaviour to ensure that male and female are in the same place at the same time. This gives the best chance of fertilisation occurring before water currents sweep the sex cells away.\\n---\\n106   ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY                         REPRODUCTION IN HUMANS',\n",

(The oviduct is also known as the Fallopian tube.) This is called ovulation. If an egg is present in the oviduct, then it may be fertilised by sperm introduced during intercourse. The zygote formed will begin to develop into an embryo, which will implant in the lining of the uterus. Here, the embryo will develop a placenta, which will allow the embryo to obtain materials such as oxygen and nutrients from the mother's blood. It also allows the embryo to get rid of waste products such as urea and carbon dioxide, as well as anchoring the embryo in the uterus. The placenta secretes female hormones, in particular progesterone, which maintain the pregnancy and prevent the embryo from aborting (being rejected by the mother's body). Figure 9.8 shows the structure and position of the placenta.\\n\\n## Figure 9.8 The position of the fetus just before birth, and the structure of the placenta\\n\\n### Left image\\n- umbilical cord\\n- placenta\",\n",

The amnion secretes a fluid called amniotic fluid, which protects the developing embryo against sudden movements and bumps. As the embryo develops, it becomes more and more complex. When it becomes recognisably human, we no longer call it an embryo but a fetus. At the end of nine months of development, there just isn't any room left for the fetus to grow and it sends a hormonal 'signal' to the mother to begin the birth process. Figure 9.8 also shows the position of a human fetus just before birth.\\n\\nThere are three stages to the birth of a child:\",\n",
       "  \"There are three stages to the birth of a child:\\n\\n1. Dilation of the cervix. The cervix is the 'neck' of the uterus. It gets wider to allow the baby to pass through. The muscles of the uterus contract quite strongly and tears the amnion, allowing the amniotic fluid to escape. (In some countries the woman describes this as 'her waters have broken'.)\\n\\n2. Delivery of the baby. Strong contractions of the muscles of the uterus push the baby's head through the cervix and then through the vagina to the outside world.\\n\\n3. Delivery of the afterbirth. After the baby has been born, the uterus continues to contract and pushes the placenta out, together with the membranes that surrounded the baby. These are known as the afterbirth.\\n\\nFigure 9.9 shows the stages of birth.\\n\\n| Stage | Description |\\n|-------|-------------|\\n| 1 | Baby's head pushes cervix; mucous plug dislodges and waters break. |\\n| 2 | Uterus contracts to push baby out through the vagina. |\\n| 3 | The placenta becomes detached from the wall of the uterus and is expelled through the vagina as the afterbirth. |\\n\\n## HORMONES CONTROLLING REPRODUCTION\\n\\nMost animals are unable to reproduce when they are young.

When a baby is born, it is recognisable as a boy or girl by its sex organs.\\n\\nThe presence of male or female sex organs is known as the primary sex characteristics. During their teens, changes happen to boys and girls that lead to sexual maturity. These changes are controlled by hormones, and the time when they happen is called puberty. Puberty involves two developments. The first is that the gametes (eggs and sperm) start to mature and be released. The second is that the bodies of both sexes adapt to allow reproduction to take place. These events are started by hormones released by the pituitary gland.\\n\\nIn boys, these pituitary hormones stimulate sperm production and instruct the testes to secrete the male sex hormone, testosterone. Testosterone controls the development of the male secondary sexual characteristics. These include growth of the penis and testes, growth of facial and body hair, muscle\\n\\n> DID YOU KNOW?\\n> \\n> Just before birth, the fetus takes up so much room that many of the mother's organs are moved out of position.

       "  \"Figure 9.12 Eggs developing inside the follicles of an ovary: The large follicle contains a fully\\n                                          developed egg ready for ovulation.\\n---\\nWhile this is going on, the lining of the uterus has been repaired after menstruation, and has thickened. This change is brought about by the hormone oestrogen, which is secreted by the ovaries.\\n\\nAfter the egg has been released, it travels down the oviduct to the uterus. It is here in the oviduct that fertilisation may happen, if sexual intercourse has taken place. What's left of the follicle now forms a structure in the ovary called the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum makes another hormone called progesterone. Progesterone completes the development of the uterus lining, by thickening and maintaining it, ready for the fertilised egg to sink into it and develop into an embryo.\",\n",
       "  \"If the egg is not fertilised, the corpus luteum breaks down and stops making progesterone. The lining of the uterus then passes out through the woman's vagina during menstruation. If, however, the egg is fertilised, the corpus luteum carries on making progesterone, the lining is not shed, and menstruation doesn't happen. The first sign that tells a woman she is pregnant is when her monthly periods stop. Later on in pregnancy, the placenta secretes progesterone, taking over the role of the corpus luteum.\\n\\n## EXTENSION WORK\\n\\n'Corpus luteum' is Latin for 'yellow body'.

It covers many aspects of plant life, including nutrition (photosynthesis), movement of materials around the plant, and reproduction. There are many reasons why we need to study how plants work, not least because they provide the world's food supply and oxygen. Animals, including humans, could not exist without plants. Modern agriculture depends on the scientific study of plant physiology, as does our understanding of ecosystems.\\n---\",\n",
       "  '# 10 PLANTS AND FOOD\\n\\nThis chapter looks at photosynthesis, the process by which plants make starch, and the structure of leaves in relation to photosynthesis. It also deals with how plants obtain other nutrients, and their uses in the plant.\\n\\n## LEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n- Investigate photosynthesis by testing for the production of starch in a leaf\\n- Investigate the need for light, carbon dioxide and chlorophyll for photosynthesis\\n- Understand the process of photosynthesis and its importance in the conversion of light energy to chemical energy\\n- Know the word equation and the balanced symbol equation for photosynthesis\\n- Describe the structure of the leaf and explain how it is adapted for photosynthesis\\n- Understand how light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration and temperature affect the rate of photosynthesis\\n- Investigate photosynthesis using the evolution of oxygen from a water plant\\n- Understand that plants require mineral ions for growth, and that magnesium ions are needed to make chlorophyll and nitrate ions are needed to make amino acids\\n\\n## PLANTS MAKE STARCH',\n",
       "  \"## PLANTS MAKE STARCH\\n\\nAll the foods shown in Figure 10.1 are products of plants. Some, such as potatoes, rice and bread (made from cereals such as wheat or rye), form the staple diet of humans. They all contain starch, which is the main storage carbohydrate made by plants. Starch is a good way of storing carbohydrate because it insoluble, compact and can be broken down easily.\\n\\nFigure 10.1 All these foods are made by plants or made from products of plants. They all contain starch.\\n---\\n## ACTIVITY 1\\n\\n### PRACTICAL: TESTING LEAVES FOR STARCH\\n\\nYou can test for starch in food by adding a few drops of yellow-brown iodine solution (see Chapter 4). If the food contains starch, a blue-black colour is produced.\\n\\nLeaves that have been in sunlight also contain starch, but you can't test for it by adding iodine solution to a fresh leaf. The outer waxy surface of the leaf will not absorb the solution, and besides, the green colour of the leaf would hide the colour change. To test for starch in a leaf, the outer waxy layer needs to be removed and the leaf decolourised. This is done by placing the leaf in boiling ethanol (see Figure 10.2).\",\n",
       "  'A beaker of water is set up on a tripod and gauze and the water heated until it boils. A leaf is removed from a plant and killed by placing it in boiling water for 30 seconds (this stops all chemical reactions in the leaf).\\n\\nThe Bunsen burner is turned off (this is important because ethanol is highly flammable), the leaf is placed in a boiling tube containing ethanol, and the tube is placed in the beaker of hot water. The boiling point of ethanol (about 78°C) is lower than that of water (100°C) so the ethanol will boil for a few minutes, until the water cools down. This is long enough to remove most of the chlorophyll from the leaf.\\n\\nWhen the leaf has turned colourless or pale yellow, it is removed and washed in cold water to soften it, then spread out on a tile and covered with a few drops of iodine solution.

The plant uses up the starch stores in its leaves. De-starched plants are used to find out the conditions needed for the plant to make more starch by photosynthesis.\\n\\nStarch is only made in the parts of plants that contain chlorophyll. You can show this by testing a leaf from a variegated plant, which has green and white areas to its leaves. The white parts of the leaf will give a negative starch test, staining yellow-brown with iodine solution. Only the green areas will stain blue-black. Figure 10.3 shows the results of a starch test on a leaf. The leaf was taken from a plant that had been under a bright light for 24 hours.\",\n",
       "  '![Figure 10.3 Testing a leaf for starch: (a) Leaf before test (b) Decolourised leaf (c) Leaf after test, stained blue-black with iodine solution.]\\n\\n## HINT\\n\\nYou might think that the results of the test on the variegated leaf prove that chlorophyll is needed for photosynthesis. But is this conclusion fully justified? The leaf could have photosynthesised in the white areas and the sugars been transported elsewhere in the plant. Similarly, the green areas may not be photosynthesising at all, but simply laying down starch from glucose made somewhere else. All it really shows is that starch is present in the green areas and not in the white areas of the leaf. We assume this is because chlorophyll is needed for photosynthesis.\\n\\n![Figure 10.4 Demonstration that carbon dioxide is needed for photosynthesis. The soda lime absorbs carbon dioxide from the air in the bell jar. A Control experiment should be set up, using exactly the same apparatus but without the soda lime.]',\n",
       "  \"Taking away the source of light is not the only way you can prevent a plant making starch in its leaves. You can also place it in a closed container containing a chemical called soda lime (Figure 10.4). This substance absorbs carbon dioxide from the air around the plant. If the plant is kept under a bright light but with no carbon dioxide, it again won't be able to make starch.\\n\\n## WHERE DOES THE STARCH COME FROM?\\n\\nYou have now found out three important facts about starch production by leaves:\\n\\n- it uses carbon dioxide from the air\\n- it needs light\\n- it needs chlorophyll in the leaves.\\n\\nAs well as starch, there is another product of this process which is essential to the existence of most living things on the Earth – oxygen. When a plant is in the light, it makes oxygen gas. You can show this using an aquatic plant such as Elodea (Canadian pondweed). When a piece of this plant is placed in a test tube of water under a bright light, it produces a stream of small bubbles. If the bubbles are collected and their contents analysed, they are found to contain a high concentration of oxygen (Figure 10.5).\\n---\\n124 PLANT PHYSIOLOGY                         PLANTS AND FOOD\",\n",

This reduces water loss by evaporation, and acts as a barrier to the entry of disease-causing microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi.\\n\\n- The lower epidermis has many holes or pores called stomata (a single pore is a stoma). Usually the upper epidermis contains fewer or no stomata. The stomata allow carbon dioxide to diffuse into the leaf, to reach the photosynthetic tissues. They also allow oxygen and water vapour to diffuse out. Each stoma is formed as a gap between two highly specialised cells called guard cells, which can change their shape to open or close the stoma.\\n\\n- In the middle of the leaf are two layers of photosynthetic cells called the mesophyll (\"mesophyll\" just means \"middle of the leaf\"). Just below the upper epidermis is the palisade mesophyll layer. This is a tissue made of long, narrow cells, each containing hundreds of chloroplasts, and is the main site of photosynthesis.

       "  \"- Below the palisade layer is a tissue made of more rounded, loosely packed cells, with air spaces between them, called the spongy mesophyll layer.

The air spaces allow these gases to diffuse in and out of the mesophyll.\\n\\n- Water and mineral ions are supplied to the leaf by vessels in a tissue called the xylem. This forms a continuous transport system throughout the plant. Water is absorbed by the roots and passes up through the stem and through veins in the leaves in the transpiration stream. In the leaves, the water leaves the xylem and supplies the mesophyll cells.\\n\\n- The products of photosynthesis, such as sugars, are carried away from the mesophyll cells by another transport system, the phloem. The phloem supplies all other parts of the plant, so that tissues and organs that can't make their own food receive products of photosynthesis.

       "  \"## FACTORS AFFECTING THE RATE OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS\\n\\nWhen the light intensity rises, the rate of photosynthesis begins by rising too, but eventually it reaches a maximum rate. What makes the rate 'level off' (flatten) like this? It is because some other factor needed for photosynthesis is in short supply, so that increasing the light intensity does not affect the rate any more. Normally, the factor which 'holds back' the rate of photosynthesis is the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air. This is only about 0.03 to 0.04%, and the plant can only take up the carbon dioxide and fix it into carbohydrate at a certain rate. If the plant is put in a closed container with a higher than normal concentration of carbon dioxide, it will photosynthesise at a faster rate. If there is both a high light intensity and a high level of carbon dioxide, the temperature may limit the rate of photosynthesis, by limiting the rate of the chemical reactions in the leaf. A rise in temperature will then increase the rate. With normal levels of carbon dioxide, very low temperatures (close to 0 °C) slow the reactions, but high temperatures (above about 35 °C) also reduce photosynthesis by denaturing enzymes in the plant cells (see Chapter 1).\\n\\n### KEY POINT\",\n",

       "  \"## OSMOSIS\\n\\nOsmosis is the name of a process by which water moves into and out of cells. In order to understand how water moves through a plant, you need to understand the mechanism of osmosis. Osmosis happens when a material called a partially permeable membrane separates two solutions. One artificial partially permeable membrane is called Visking tubing. This is used in kidney dialysis machines. Visking tubing has microscopic holes in it, which let small molecules like water pass through (it is permeable to them) but is not permeable to some larger molecules, such as the sugar sucrose. This is why it is called 'partially' permeable. You can show the effects of osmosis by filling a Visking tubing 'sausage' with concentrated sucrose solution, attaching it to a capillary tube and placing the Visking tubing in a beaker of water (Figure 11.1).\",\n",

The cell decreases in volume and the cytoplasm no longer pushes against the cell wall. In this state, the cell is called flaccid. Eventually the cell contents shrink so much that the membrane and cytoplasm split away from the cell wall and gaps appear between the wall and the membrane. A cell like this is called plasmolysed. You can see plasmolysis happening in the plant cells shown in Figure 11.5. The space between the cell wall and the cell surface membrane will now be filled with the sucrose solution.',\n",

The cell membranes and cytoplasm can be seen to have pulled away from the cell wall.\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\n\\nThis chapter only covers plant cells. Osmosis also happens in animal cells, but there is much less water movement. This is because animal cells do not have a strong cell wall around them, and can't resist the changes in internal pressure resulting from large movements of water. For example, if red blood cells are put into water, they will swell up and burst. If the same cells are put into a concentrated salt solution, they lose water by osmosis and shrink, producing cells with crinkly edges (Figure 11.6).\\n\\nFigure 11.6 compares the red blood cells on the right, which were placed in a 3% salt solution, with the normal cells on the left.

Blood plasma has a concentration equal to a 0.85% salt solution.\\n\\nTurgor (the state a plant is in when its cells are turgid) is very important to plants. The pressure inside the cells pushes neighbouring cells against each other, like a box full of inflated balloons. This supports the non-woody parts of the plant, such as young stems and leaves, and holds stems upright, so the leaves can carry out photosynthesis properly. Turgor is also important in the functioning of stomata. If a plant loses too much water from its cells so that they become flaccid, this makes the plant wilt. You can see wilting in a pot plant which has been left for too long without water. The leaves droop and collapse. In fact this is a protective action. It cuts down water loss by reducing the exposed surface area of the leaves and closing the stomata.',\n",
       "  'Inside the plant, water moves from cell to cell by osmosis. If a cell has a higher water potential than the cell next to it, water will move from the first cell to the second. In turn, this will dilute the contents of the second cell, so that it has a higher water potential than the next cell. In this way, water can move across a plant tissue, down a gradient of water potential (Figure 11.7).\\n\\nFigure 11.7 illustrates how water moves from cell to cell down a water potential gradient:\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph LR\\n    A[A] --> B[B]\\n    B --> C[C]\\n    C --> D[D]\\n    D --> E[E]\\n    E --> F[F]\\n    \\n    A1[1.

When they are mature, the vessels contain no cytoplasm. Instead, they have a hollow central space or lumen through which the water passes. The walls of the xylem vessels contain a woody material called lignin (Figure 11.10).\\n\\nThe xylem vessels begin life as living cells with normal cytoplasm and cellulose cell walls. As they develop they become elongated, and gradually their original cellulose cell walls become impregnated with lignin, made by the cytoplasm. As this happens, the cells die, forming hollow tubes. Lignification makes them very strong, and enables them to carry water up tall plants without collapsing. Lignin is also impermeable to water.\\n\\nFigure 11.10 Xylem vessels in a stem.

Tubes in the phloem are also formed by cells arranged end-to-end, but they have cell walls made of cellulose, and retain their cytoplasm. The end of each cell is formed by a cross-wall of cellulose with holes, called a sieve plate. The living cytoplasm extends through the holes in the sieve plates, linking each cell with the next, forming a long sieve tube (Figure 11.11). The sieve tubes transport the products of photosynthesis from the leaves to other parts of the plant. Sugars for energy, or amino acids for building proteins, are carried to young leaves and other growing points in the plant. Sugar may also be taken to the roots and converted into starch for storage. Despite being living cells, the phloem sieve tubes have no nucleus. They seem to be controlled by other cells that lie alongside the sieve tubes, called companion cells (Figure 11.11).\\n\\nFigure 11.11 Xylem vessels in a stem',\n",

       "  \"# 12 CHEMICAL COORDINATION IN PLANTS\\n\\nPlants can detect changes in their environment and respond to them, but the responses are much slower than those in animals. This is because movements in a plant are brought about by changes in the plant's growth. This chapter is about these growth responses, and the chemicals that coordinate them.\\n\\n## LEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n- Understand that plants respond to stimuli\\n- Describe the phototropic response of roots and stems\\n- Describe the geotropic responses of roots and stems\\n- Understand the role of auxin in the phototropic response of stems\\n\\nChapter 6 explains how animals detect and respond to changes in their environment. Animals usually respond very quickly – for example the reflex action resulting from a painful stimulus (page 83) is over in a fraction of a second.\\n\\nAs in animals, some species of plant can respond rapidly to a stimulus, for example the Venus flytrap (Figure 12.1). This plant has modified leaves, which close quickly around their 'prey', trapping it. The plant then secretes enzymes to digest the insect. The movement is brought about by rapid changes in turgor of specialised cells at the base of the leaves.\",\n",
       "  'Figure 12.1 The Venus flytrap catches and digests insects to gain extra nutrients. The plant responds very quickly to a fly landing on one of its leaves.\\n\\n## TROPISMS\\n\\nMost plants do not respond to stimuli as quickly as the Venus flytrap, because their response normally involves a change in their rate of growth. Different parts of plants may grow at different rates, and a plant may respond to a stimulus by increasing growth near the tip of its shoot or roots.\\n\\nImagine a plant growing normally in a pot. Usually, most light will be falling on the plant from above. If you turn the plant on its side and leave it for a day or so, you will see that its shoot starts to grow upwards (Figure 12.2).',\n",
       "  \"Figure 12.2 This bean has responded to being placed horizontally. The growing shoot has started to bend upwards.\\n---\\nThere are two stimuli acting on the plant in Figure 12.2. One is the direction of the light that falls on the plant. The other stimulus is gravity. Both light and gravity are directional stimuli (they act in a particular direction). The growth response of a plant to a directional stimulus is called a **tropism**. If the growth response is towards the direction of the stimulus, it is a positive tropism, and if it is away from the direction of the stimulus, it is a negative tropism. The stem of the plant in Figure 12.2 is showing a positive **phototropism** and a negative **geotropism**, which both make the stem grow upwards.\\n\\nThe aerial part of a plant (the 'shoot') needs light to carry out photosynthesis. This means that in most species, a positive phototropism is the strongest tropic response of the shoot. If a shoot grows towards the light, it ensures that the leaves, held out at an angle to the stem, will receive the maximum amount of sunlight. This response is easily seen in any plant placed near a window, or another source of 'one-way' or unidirectional light (Figure 12.3).\",\n",
       "  \"In darkness or uniform light, the shoot shows a negative geotropism. As you might expect, the roots of plants are strongly positively geotropic. This response makes sure that the roots grow down into the soil, where they can reach water and mineral ions. Roots also fix a plant firmly in place – they provide 'anchorage'.\\n\\nThe roots of some species that have been studied are also negatively phototropic, but most roots don't respond to directional light at all. Table 12.1 summarises the main tropisms.\\n\\nTable 12.1: The main responses of plants to directional stimuli (tropisms).\\n\\n| Stimulus | Name of response | Response of shoots | Response of roots |\\n|----------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|\\n| light | phototropism | grow towards light source (positive phototropism) | most species show no response; some grow away from light (negative phototropism) |\\n| gravity | geotropism | grow away from direction of gravity (negative geotropism) | grow towards direction of gravity (positive geotropism) |\\n\\n## DETECTING THE LIGHT STIMULUS – PLANT HORMONES\",\n",
       "  \"## DETECTING THE LIGHT STIMULUS – PLANT HORMONES\\n\\nPlants do not have the obvious sense organs and nervous system of animals. However, since they respond to stimuli such as light and gravity, they must have some way of detecting them and coordinating the response. The detection system of phototropism was first investigated by the great English biologist Charles Darwin (see Chapter 19) in the late nineteenth century. Instead of using stems, Darwin (and later scientists) used cereal coleoptiles, which are easier to grow and use in experiments.\\n\\nA **coleoptile** is a protective sheath that covers the first leaves of a cereal seedling. It protects the delicate leaves as the shoot emerges through the soil (Figure 12.4). Coleoptiles have a simple structure and are easy to grow, so they are often used to investigate tropisms.\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\n- Phototropisms are growth responses to light from one direction. Geotropisms are growth responses to the direction of gravity ('geo' refers to the Earth).\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\n- Light from one direction is called 'unidirectional'. If light shines on the plant evenly from all directions, this is called 'uniform' light.\",\n",

If light shines on the plant evenly from all directions, this is called 'uniform' light.\\n\\n### EXTENSION WORK\\nCharles Darwin is best known for his theory of evolution by natural selection (Chapter 19). However, he carried out research in other areas of biology, including studying plant hormones. You could do some research to find out more about his life and work. Make a list of his achievements.\\n---\\nDarwin showed that the stimulus of unidirectional light was detected by the tip of the coleoptile, and transmitted to a growth zone, just behind the tip (Figure 12.5).\\n\\nFigure 12.5 Darwin's experiments with phototropism (1880)\\n\\n| Stage | Description | Result |\\n|-------|-------------|--------|\\n| (a) | coleoptile before experiment | Straight growth |\\n| (b) | intact coleoptile | Shows growth and curvature towards the light |\\n| (c) | coleoptile with tip removed | Shows no growth or bending |\\n| (d) | coleoptile with tip covered by opaque cap | Shows growth but no bending |\\n\\nThe figure shows the direction of light coming from the right side in all cases.\",\n",
       "  \"The figure shows the direction of light coming from the right side in all cases.\\n\\nSince plants don't have a nervous system, biologists began to look for a chemical messenger (or plant hormone) that might be the cause of phototropism in coleoptiles.

Some of their results are summarised in Figure 12.6.\\n\\nExperiment 1\\n\\n| Condition | Result |\\n|-----------|--------|\\n| tip of coleoptile removed | - |\\n| tip replaced on mica sheet | no bending |\\n| tip replaced on gelatine block | normal bending towards light |\\n\\nThe figure shows the direction of light coming from the right side.\\n\\nExperiment 2\\n\\n| Condition | Result |\\n|-----------|--------|\\n| tip removed | No bending |\\n| tip replaced on one side | - |\\n| - | bending occurs without unilateral light stimulus |\\n\\nThese experiments demonstrate the role of the coleoptile tip in detecting light and initiating the bending response, as well as the potential involvement of a chemical messenger in transmitting the signal from the tip to the growth zone.\\n---\\n## Experiment 3\\n\\n[Diagram showing three stages of an experiment with plant coleoptiles]\",\n",

This made biologists think that the stimulus was a chemical that was soluble in water.\\n\\nIn experiment 2, it was shown that the phototropic response could be brought about, even without unidirectional light, by removing a coleoptile tip ('decapitating' the coleoptile) and placing the tip on one side of the decapitated stalk.\\n\\nIn experiment 3, it was found that the hormone could be collected in another water-absorbing material (a block of agar jelly). Placing the agar block on one side of the decapitated coleoptile stalk caused it to bend.\",\n",
       "  \"Investigations like experiments 2 and 3 led scientists to believe that the hormone caused bending by stimulating growth on the side of the coleoptile furthest from the light. The theory is that the hormone is produced in the tip of the shoot, and diffuses back down the shoot. If the shoot is in the dark, or if light is all around the shoot, the hormone diffuses at equal rates on each side of the shoot, so it stimulates the shoot equally on all sides. However, if the shoot is receiving light from one direction, the hormone moves away from the light as it diffuses downwards. The higher concentration of hormone on the 'dark' side of the shoot stimulates cells there to grow, making the shoot bend towards the light (Figure 12.7).\\n\\n[Diagram showing how plant hormone causes phototropism]\\n\\nFigure 12.7 How movement of a plant hormone causes phototropism.\\n\\nSince these experiments were carried out, scientists have identified the hormone responsible. It is called auxin. Several other types of plant hormone have been found. Like auxin, they all influence growth and development of plants in one way or another, so that many scientists prefer to call them plant growth substances rather than plant hormones.\\n\\n### EXTENSION WORK\",\n",

They control many aspects of plant growth and development, apart from tropisms. These include growth of buds, leaves and fruit, fruit ripening, seed germination, leaf fall and opening of stomata, to name just a few.\\n\\n## USING A CLINOSTAT TO SHOW TROPISMS\\n\\nA clinostat is a piece of apparatus consisting of an electric motor turning a cork disc.

Most involve some part of the plant growing, and then breaking away from the parent plant before developing into a new plant (Figure 13.1).\\n\\nGardeners often take advantage of the ways that plants can reproduce asexually.

This takes place through pollination, which is normally carried out either by wind or insects. Following pollination, fertilisation takes place and the zygote formed develops into a seed, which, in turn, becomes enclosed in a fruit.\\n\\n### PRODUCTION OF GAMETES AND POLLINATION\\n\\nThe gametes are produced by meiosis in structures in the flowers.

However, for fertilisation to take place, the nucleus of the pollen grain (the male gamete) must fuse with the nucleus of the ovum, which is inside an ovule in the ovary. To transfer the nucleus to the ovum, the pollen grain forms a pollen tube, which grows down through the tissue of the style and into the ovary. Here it curves around to enter the opening in an ovule. The tip of the tube dissolves and allows the pollen grain nucleus to move out of the tube and into the ovule. Here it fertilises the ovum nucleus.

The non-living (physical) components are the abiotic components (compare these with biotic and abiotic factors, below).\\n\\nAn ecosystem contains a variety of habitats.

Instead, he is forced to count a smaller representative part of the population, called a sample. Sampling of plants, or animals that do not move much (such as snails), can be done using a sampling square called a quadrat. A quadrat is usually made from metal, wood or plastic. The size of quadrat you use depends on the size of the organisms being sampled. For example, to count plants growing on a school field, you could use a quadrat with sides 0.5 or 1 metre in length (Figure 14.4).\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\n\\nDecomposers are fungi and some species of bacteria.

Interactions include the following.\\n\\n- Feeding among the organisms – the plants, animals and decomposers are continually recycling the same nutrients through the ecosystem.\\n- Competition among the organisms – animals compete for food, shelter, mates, nesting sites; plants compete for carbon dioxide, mineral ions, light and water.\\n- Interactions between organisms and the environment – plants absorb mineral ions, carbon dioxide and water from the environment; plants also give off water vapour and oxygen into the environment; animals use materials from the environment to build shelters; the temperature of the environment can affect processes occurring in the organisms; processes occurring in organisms can affect the temperature of the environment (all organisms produce some heat).\\n\\n### REMINDER',\n",
       "  \"### REMINDER\\n\\nDon't forget that plants take in carbon dioxide and give out oxygen only when there is sufficient light for photosynthesis to occur efficiently. When there is little light, plants take in oxygen and give out carbon dioxide. You should be able to explain the reasons for this (see Chapter 10).\\n---\\n## BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC FACTORS\\n\\nThere are many factors that influence the numbers and distribution of organisms in an ecosystem. There are two types of factor – biotic and abiotic.\\n\\nBiotic factors are biological. Many (but not all) involve feeding relationships. They include:\\n\\n- availability of food and competition for food resources\\n- predation\\n- parasitism\\n- disease\\n- presence of pollinating insects\\n- availability of nest sites.\\n\\nAbiotic factors are physical or chemical factors. They include:\\n\\n- climate, such as light intensity, temperature and water availability\\n- hours of daylight\\n- soil conditions, such as clay content, nitrate level, particle size, water content and pH\\n- other factors specific to a particular habitat, such as salinity (salt content) in an estuary, flow rate in a river, or oxygen concentration in a lake\\n- pollution.\",\n",
       "  'Clearly which factors affect population sizes and distribution of organisms will depend on the type of ecosystem. If you take the example of a river, some of the main abiotic factors could be:\\n\\n- depth of water\\n- flow rate\\n- type of material at the bottom of the stream (stones, sand, mud etc.)\\n- concentration of minerals in the water\\n- pH\\n- oxygen concentration\\n- cloudiness of the water\\n- presence of any pollution.\\n\\nThe main biotic factors affecting animals in the river will be food supply, either from plants or other animals. But other factors are important too – large fish could not live in a shallow stream!\\n\\nIt is impossible to generalise about which factors are the most important. In a heavily polluted river all the organisms could be killed by the pollution, while in a clean river depth and flow rate might have a greater effect on the animals that could live there. The different factors may also affect one another. For example, a faster flow rate could mix the water with air, increasing the amount of dissolved oxygen.',\n",
       "  'The main factor affecting large ecosystems is climate, particularly temperature and rainfall. Climate is the reason why tropical rainforests are restricted to a strip near the equator of the Earth, while pine forests grow in the higher latitudes of the northern hemisphere.\\n\\n### KEY POINTS\\n\\nA predator is an animal that kills and eats another animal. A parasite is an organism (animal or plant) that lives in or on another organism (called its host) and gets its nutrition from the host. e.g. mosquitoes are parasites of humans (and other animals), and the human is the host of the mosquito.\\n\\nLarge areas of the Earth dominated by a specific type of vegetation are called biomes. Temperate grassland and tropical rain forest are two examples of biomes. You could carry out some research to find out about these and other biomes.\\n---\\n## FEEDING RELATIONSHIPS\\n\\nThe simplest way of showing feeding relationships within an ecosystem is a food chain (Figure 14.6).',\n",
       "  \"The simplest way of showing feeding relationships within an ecosystem is a food chain (Figure 14.6).\\n\\nIn any food chain, the arrow (→) means 'is eaten by'. In the food chain illustrated, the grass is the producer. It is a plant so it can photosynthesise and produce food materials. The grasshopper is the primary consumer. It is an animal which eats the producer and is also a herbivore. The lizard is the secondary consumer. It eats the primary consumer and is also a carnivore. The different stages in a food chain (producer, primary consumer and secondary consumer) are called trophic levels.\\n\\nMany food chains have more than three links in them. Here are two examples of longer food chains:\\n\\nfilamentous algae → mayfly nymph → caddis fly larvae → salmon\\n\\nIn this freshwater food chain, the extra link in the chain makes the salmon a tertiary consumer.\\n\\nplankton → crustacean → fish → ringed seal → polar bear\\n\\nIn this marine (sea) food chain, the fifth link makes the polar bear a quaternary consumer.

The marine food chain above implies that only crustaceans feed on plankton, which is not true. Some whales and other mammals also feed on plankton. For a fuller understanding, you need to consider how the different food chains in an ecosystem relate to each other.

But, as farmyard manure is made from livestock faeces and indigestible fodder, it can only replace a portion of the lost nitrogen. Most farmers apply inorganic fertilisers to replace the nitrates and other mineral ions lost. While this can replace all the lost ions, it can also lead to pollution problems, which we will discuss later. Inorganic fertilisers do not improve soil structure in the way that organic fertilisers can, because they do not contain any decaying matter that is an essential part of the soil.\",\n",
       "  \"Another way to replace lost nitrates is to grow a legume crop (e.g. clover) in a field one year in four. Legumes have nitrogen-fixing bacteria in nodules on their roots. These bacteria convert nitrogen gas in the soil air to ammonium ions. Some of this is passed to the plants, which use it to make proteins. At the end of the season, the crop is ploughed back into the soil, and decomposers convert the nitrogen in the proteins to ammonia. This is then oxidised to nitrate by nitrifying bacteria and made available for next year's crop.\\n\\n## PEST CONTROL\\n\\nPests are organisms that reduce the yield of crop plants or stock animals. The 'yield' of a crop is the amount produced for sale. A pest can harm this in two ways:\\n\\n- lowering the amount by reducing growth, e.g. by damaging leaves and reducing photosynthesis\\n- affecting the appearance or quality of a crop, making it unsuitable for sale (Figure 15.6).\\n\\n> **DID YOU KNOW?**\\n> In Britain, about 30% of the potential maize crop is lost to weeds, insects and fungal diseases (Figure 15.6).\",\n",

Pests are only a problem when they are present in big enough numbers to cause economic damage – a few whiteflies in a tomato crop are not a problem; the real damage arises when there are millions of them. Whether or not a farmer uses pesticides is largely a decision based on cost. The increase in income due to higher yields must be set against the cost of the pesticides.\\n\\n## PROBLEMS WITH PESTICIDES\\n\\nOne problem with using pesticides is that a pest may develop resistance to the chemical. This happens through natural selection (see Chapter 19). It makes the existing pesticide useless, so that another must be found. Other problems are to do with the fact that pesticides can cause environmental damage. There are several reasons for this:',\n",
       "  '- they may be slow to decompose – they are persistent in the environment\\n- they build up in the tissues of organisms – bioaccumulation\\n- they build up and become more concentrated along food chains – biomagnification\\n- they kill other insects that are harmless, as well as helpful species, such as bees.\\n\\nAn ideal pesticide should:\\n- control the pest effectively\\n- be biodegradable, so that no toxic products are left in the soil or on crops\\n- be specific, so that only the pest is killed\\n- not accumulate in organisms\\n- be safe to transport, store and apply\\n- be easy to apply.\\n\\nWe can explain these problems by looking at one well-documented example – the insecticide DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane).\\n\\nDDT was invented in 1874, and first discovered to be an insecticide in 1939. In World War II it was used with great success to kill malaria carrying mosquitoes and the lice that carried typhus. Its use increased up until the 1960s, when we began to understand its harmful effects. It was banned from general use in the USA in 1972, and worldwide in 2004. Limited use of DDT is still allowed for control of insects that transmit disease, although this is still regarded as controversial.\\n\\n### DID YOU KNOW?',\n",
       "  \"### DID YOU KNOW?\\n\\nCultivating large areas of land with a single crop (a monoculture) encourages pests. Monocultures make harvesting the crop easier. But if a pest arrives, it can easily spread through the crop. During the winter the pest can lie dormant in the soil ready to attack next year's crop. Crop rotation breaks the pest cycle. This is where a different crop is grown each year (Figure 15.7). When over-wintering pests emerge, their preferred crop is no longer there.\\n\\nFigure 15.7 A three-year crop rotation\\n\\n### DID YOU KNOW?\\n\\nDDT is a historical case, but there are problems with many modern pesticides. One recent example involves a class of insecticides called neonicotinoids (chemicals similar to nicotine). They have been linked to several serious ecological problems, including honey bee colony collapse disorder (CCD) and loss of birds due to a reduction in insect populations.\\n\\nDDT is a very effective insecticide, so why has it been banned?\",\n",
       "  \"DDT is a very effective insecticide, so why has it been banned?\\n\\n- DDT is very persistent, remaining active in the environment for many years. If DDT is sprayed onto a field, around half will still be there ten years later. To make things worse, the missing half won't have degraded to harmless products – some will have broken down to form a similar compound called DDE, which is also a potent insecticide, and some will have spread to other habitats. DDT is carried all around the world by wind, and has been identified in polar ice caps and deserts, thousands of kilometres away from where it was applied.\\n\\n- By the 1950s, many types of insect began to appear that were resistant to DDT. These insects had developed a genetic mutation that prevented them from being killed by the insecticide. While DDT continued to be used, the resistant insects had an advantage over the non-resistant ones. Their numbers increased with every generation since they were able to survive exposure to the pesticide. They reproduced, passing on their resistance genes to their offspring. This is an example of natural selection (see Chapter 19). There are now hundreds of examples of pest species that have\\n---\\ndeveloped resistance to different insecticides.\",\n",
       "  \"- DDT doesn't just kill pests. It will kill any type of insect, including harmless ones such as butterflies and useful species such as bees, as well as natural predators such as wasps, which might themselves kill the pest insects. Insecticides damage ecosystems by disrupting food chains.\\n\\n- DDT is very soluble in fats. When a herbivore feeds on plants that are contaminated with DDT, the insecticide is not broken down or excreted. Instead it becomes concentrated in the fatty tissues of the animal. This is called bioaccumulation. When a carnivore eats the herbivore this process is repeated, so that the insecticide builds up in concentration along the food chain. This is known as biomagnification (Figure 15.8). The levels at the top of the food chain may be toxic, leading to the death of the top carnivores in the chain. This can disrupt the food web of an ecosystem.\\n\\n| Organism    | DDT Concentration |\\n|-------------|-------------------|\\n| plankton    | (0.000 0003)      |\\n| crustaceans | (0.04)            |\\n| small fish  | (0.5)             |\\n| large fish  | (2.0)             |\\n| fish eagle  | (25)              |\\n\\nFigure 15.8 Biomagnification of DDT in a food chain\\n\\n## BIOLOGICAL CONTROL\",\n",
       "  'Figure 15.8 Biomagnification of DDT in a food chain\\n\\n## BIOLOGICAL CONTROL\\n\\nAnother option that may be used to control pests is biological control. Instead of using a toxic chemical, biological control uses another organism to reduce the numbers of a pest. We have already mentioned whiteflies as pests of tomatoes. One way of controlling them in large glasshouses is to introduce a parasite that will kill the whiteflies. A tiny wasp called Encarsia parasitises and kills their larvae, reducing the numbers of adult whitefly.\\n\\nA problem with biological control is that it never fully gets rid of a pest. If the control organism killed all the pests, then it too would die out, as it would have no food supply. Biological control aims to reduce pest numbers to a level where they no longer cause significant economic damage (Figure 15.9).\\n\\nThere are several methods of biological control. Some examples include:\\n\\n- introducing a natural predator – ladybirds can be used to control the populations of aphids in orange groves\\n\\n- introducing a herbivore – a moth was introduced from South America to control the prickly pear cactus that was becoming a serious weed in grazing land in Australia',\n",

They are used to attract pests (either males or females) to traps. The pests are then destroyed, reducing the reproductive potential of the population. Male-attracting pheromones are used to control aphids (greenfly) in plum crops.\\n---\\n# AIR POLLUTION\\n\\nOne definition of pollution is:\\n\\n'Pollution is the contamination of the environment by harmful substances that are produced by the activities of humans'.\\n\\nHuman activities pollute the air with many gases.

Over the last 100 years alone, the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by nearly 30%. This rise is mainly due to the increased burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and natural gas, as well as petrol and diesel in vehicle engines. It has been made worse by cutting down large areas of tropical rainforest (see later in this chapter). These extensive forests have been called 'the lungs of the Earth' because they absorb such vast quantities of carbon dioxide and produce equally large amounts of oxygen. Extensive deforestation (see below) means that less carbon dioxide is being absorbed. Figure 15.10 shows changes in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (in parts per million) from 1960 to 2010.\\n\\nFigure 15.11 Seasonal fluctuations in carbon dioxide levels\\n\\nFigure 15.11 Seasonal fluctuations in carbon dioxide levels\",\n",

Without leaves they cannot photosynthesise and so do not absorb carbon dioxide. They still respire, which produces carbon dioxide, so in the winter months, they give out carbon dioxide and the level in the atmosphere rises. In the spring and summer, with new leaves and brighter sunlight, the trees photosynthesise faster than they respire. As a result, they absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than they produce, so the level decreases. However, because there are fewer trees overall, it doesn't quite return to the low level of the previous summer.\\n\\nFigure 15.10 Changes in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere\\n\\nFigure 15.10 Changes in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\\n\\nThe increased levels of carbon dioxide and other gases contribute to global warming, or the enhanced greenhouse effect.

Household sewage consists of wastewater from kitchens and bathrooms and contains human urine and faeces, as well as dissolved organic and inorganic chemicals such as soaps and detergents. It is carried away in pipes called sewers, to be treated before it enters waterways such as rivers or the sea.\",\n",

It refers to a situation where large amounts of nutrients enter a body of water, such as a river, lake or even the sea. The nutrients in question are inorganic mineral ions, usually nitrates or phosphates. Pollution by these minerals can have very harmful effects on an aquatic ecosystem.\\n\\nThere are two main sources of excess minerals:\\n\\n- from untreated or treated sewage\\n- from artificial nitrate or phosphate fertilisers.\\n---\\n188 ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT | HUMAN INFLUENCES ON THE ENVIRONMENT\\n\\nEutrophication is often caused by the use of artificial fertiliser. Streams and rivers that run through agricultural land that have been treated with fertiliser can contain high concentrations of nitrate and phosphate. This is because nitrate is very soluble in water, and is easily washed out of the soil by rain, a process known as leaching. This is less of a problem with phosphate fertiliser, but phosphate is also washed into waterways by surface run-off of water.\",\n",

Because the bacteria respire aerobically, they use up the oxygen in the water. In addition, the algae block the light from reaching other rooted plants, further decreasing the oxygen produced by photosynthesis. The low oxygen levels can result in fish and other aerobic animals dying. In severe cases, the water becomes anoxic (containing very little oxygen) and smelly from gases like hydrogen sulfide and methane from the bacteria. By this stage only anaerobic bacteria can survive.\\n\\nRapid eutrophication is less likely when farmers use organic fertiliser (manure).

       "  \"[Image showing:\\n- A person\\n- A cell with nucleus (contains chromosomes)\\n- A chromosome (contains DNA)\\n- DNA molecule with gene length indicated]\\n\\nThe chemical that is the basis of inheritance in nearly all organisms is DNA. DNA consists of two strands looking like a twisted ladder - the famous 'double helix'. The 'sides' of the ladder are made of alternating sugar and phosphate groups. The 'rungs' of the ladder are made of pairs of nitrogen-containing groups called bases (Figure 16.2). There are four bases called adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine. The base adenine always pairs with thymine, and cytosine with guanine. These are called complementary base pairs. DNA is usually found in the nucleus of a cell, in the chromosomes (Figure 16.1).\\n\\nA small section of DNA that determines a particular feature is called a gene. Genes determine features by instructing cells to produce particular proteins which then lead to the development of the feature. So a gene can also be described as a section of DNA that codes for a particular protein.\\n\\nDNA can replicate (make an exact copy of) itself. When a cell divides by mitosis (see Chapter 17), each new cell receives exactly the same type and amount of DNA. The cells formed are genetically identical.\\n\\n---\\n## THE STRUCTURE OF CHROMOSOMES\",\n",
       "  '---\\n## THE STRUCTURE OF CHROMOSOMES\\n\\nEach chromosome contains one double-stranded DNA molecule. The DNA is folded and coiled so that it can be packed into a small space. The DNA is coiled around proteins called histones (Figure 16.3).\\n\\n[A detailed diagram showing the structure of a chromosome, labeled as Figure 16.3.

Another chromosome will contain a different DNA molecule, and so will contain different genes.\\n\\n## HOW MANY CHROMOSOMES?\\n\\nNearly all human cells contain 46 chromosomes. The photographs in Figure 16.4 show the 46 chromosomes from the body cells of a human male.\\n\\n[An image showing 23 pairs of chromosomes arranged in a grid, numbered 1-22, plus X and Y]',\n",

A body cell from a female has 23 matching pairs including a pair of X chromosomes.\\n\\n## REMINDER\\n\\nRed blood cells have no nucleus and therefore no chromosomes.

The offspring from sexual reproduction vary genetically for a number of reasons. One reason is because of the huge variation in the gametes. Another reason is because of the random way in which fertilisation takes place. In humans, any one of the billions of sperm formed by a male during his life could, potentially, fertilise any one of the thousands of ova formed by a female.',\n",
       "  \"This variation applies to both male and female gametes. So, just using our 'low' estimate of about 8.5 million different types of human gametes means that there can be 8.5 million different types of sperm and 8.5 million different types of ova. When fertilisation takes place, any sperm could fertilise any ovum. The number of possible combinations of chromosomes (and genes) in the zygote is 8.5 million × 8.5 million = 7.2 × 10¹³, or 72 trillion! And remember, this is using our 'low' number!\\n\\nThis means that every individual is likely to be genetically unique. The only exceptions are identical twins. Identical twins are formed from the same zygote – they are sometimes called monozygotic twins. When the zygote divides by mitosis, the two genetically identical cells formed do not 'stay together'. Instead, they separate and each cell behaves as though it were an individual zygote, dividing and developing into an embryo (Figure 17.6). Because they have developed from genetically identical cells (and, originally, from the same\\n\\n▲ Figure 17.6 How identical twins are formed\\n\\n[Diagram showing zygote division and embryo formation for identical twins]\\n---\\n# VARIATION AND SELECTION\\n\\n## CELL DIVISION\",\n",

Each seed contains an embryo, which results from a pollen grain nucleus fusing with an egg cell nucleus. Embryos from the same plant will vary genetically because they are formed by different pollen grains fertilising different egg cells and so contain different combinations of genes.\\n\\n## ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION AND CLONING\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\nCloning is a process that produces a group of genetically identical offspring (a clone) from part of the parent organism.

Gametes are not involved.\\n\\nPlant breeders have known for a long time that sexual reproduction produces variation. They realised that if a plant had some desirable feature, the best way to get more of that plant was not to collect and plant its seeds, but to clone it in some way. Modern plant-breeding techniques allow the production of many thousands of identical plants from just a few cells of the original (see Chapter 19).\\n\\nWhen organisms reproduce asexually, there is no fusion of gametes. A part of the organism grows and somehow breaks away from the parent organism. The cells it contains were formed by mitosis, so contain exactly the same genes as the parent. Asexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically identical to the parent, and genetically identical to each other.\\n\\nAsexual reproduction is common in plants (see Chapter 13). For example, flower bulbs grow and divide asexually each season to produce more bulbs.

       "  \"# GENES AND INHERITANCE\\n\\nHow and why do we inherit features from our parents? This chapter answers these questions by looking at the work of Gregor Mendel and how he has helped us to understand the mysteries of inheritance.\\n\\n## LEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n- Understand that genes exist in alternative forms called alleles which give rise to differences in inherited characteristics\\n- Understand the meaning of the terms dominant, recessive, homozygous, heterozygous, phenotype and genotype\\n- Describe patterns of monohybrid inheritance using genetic diagrams\\n- Predict probabilities of outcomes from monohybrid crosses\\n- Understand how to interpret family pedigrees\\n- Understand how the sex of a person is controlled by one pair of chromosomes, XX in a female and XY in a male\\n- Describe the determination of the sex of offspring at fertilisation, using a genetic diagram\\n- Understand that most phenotypic features are the result of polygenic inheritance rather than single genes\\n\\nThe groundbreaking research that uncovered the rules of how genes are inherited was carried out by Gregor Mendel and published in 1865. The rules of inheritance are now known as 'Mendelian genetics' in his honour.\\n\\n## GREGOR MENDEL\",\n",
       "  \"## GREGOR MENDEL\\n\\nGregor Mendel was a monk who lived in a monastery in Brno in what is now the Czech Republic (Figure 18.1). He became interested in the science of heredity, and carried out hundreds of breeding experiments using pea plants. From his research Mendel was able to explain the laws governing inheritance.\\n\\nMendel found that for every feature or 'character' he investigated:\\n\\n- a 'heritable unit' (what we now call a gene) is passed from one generation to the next\\n- the heritable unit (gene) can have alternative forms (we now call these different forms alleles)\\n- each individual must have two alternative forms (alleles) per feature\\n- the gametes only have one of the alternative forms (allele) per feature\\n- one allele can be dominant over the other.\",\n",
       "  \"Mendel used these ideas to predict outcomes of cross-breeding or 'crosses' between plants, which he tested in his breeding experiments. He published his results and ideas in 1865 but few people took any notice, and his work went unrecognised for many years. It wasn't until 1900 that other biologists working on inheritance rediscovered Mendel's work and realised its importance. In 1903, the connection between the behaviour of genes in Mendelian genetics and the behaviour of chromosomes in meiosis was noticed and the science of genetics was established.\\n---\\n## VARIATION AND SELECTION\\n\\n### MENDEL'S EXPERIMENTS ON INHERITANCE\\n\\nMendel noticed that many of the features of pea plants had two alternative forms. For example, plants were either tall or very short (called a 'dwarf' variety); they either had purple or white flowers; they produced yellow seeds or green seeds. There were no intermediate forms, no pale purple flowers or green/yellow seeds or intermediate height plants. Figure 18.2 shows some of the contrasting features of pea plants that Mendel used in his breeding experiments.\",\n",

For example, any tall pea plants he used came from generations of pea plants that had all been tall.\\n\\nMendel decided to investigate, systematically, the results of cross breeding plants that had contrasting features. These were the 'parent plants', referred to as 'P' in genetic diagrams. He transferred pollen from one experimental plant to another. He also made sure that the plants could not be self-fertilised.\",\n",
       "  \"He collected all the seeds formed, grew them and noted the features that each plant developed. These plants were the first generation of offspring, called the F₁ generation. He did not cross-pollinate these plants, but allowed them to self-fertilise. Again, he collected the seeds, grew them and noted the features that each plant developed. These plants formed the second generation of offspring or F₂ generation. When Mendel used pure-breeding tall and pure-breeding dwarf plants as his parents, he obtained the results shown in Figure 18.3.\\n---\\n# VARIATION AND SELECTION GENES AND INHERITANCE 213\\n\\nP\\n\\ntall parent dwarf parent\\n\\n↓\\n\\nF₁\\n\\nall tall plants\\n\\n↓\\n\\nF₂\\n\\ntall plant tall plant tall plant dwarf plant\\n\\n3 tall : 1 dwarf\\n\\n▲ Figure 18.3 A summary of Mendel's results from breeding tall pea plants with dwarf pea plants.\\n\\nMendel obtained similar results when he carried out breeding experiments using plants with other pairs of contrasting characters (Figure 18.4). He noticed two things in particular.\\n\\n■ All the plants of the F₁ generation were of one type. This type was not a blend of the two parental features, but one or the other. For example, when tall and dwarf parents were crossed, all the F₁ plants were tall.\",\n",
       "  \"■ There was always a 3:1 ratio of types in the F₂ generation. Three-quarters of the plants in the F₂ generation were of the type that appeared in the F₁ generation. One-quarter showed the other parental feature. For example, when tall F₁ plants were crossed, three-quarters of the F₂ plants were tall and one-quarter were dwarf.\\n\\nMendel was able to use his findings to work out how features were inherited, despite having no knowledge of chromosomes, genes or meiosis. Nowadays we can use our understanding of these ideas to explain Mendel's results.\\n---\\n## VARIATION AND SELECTION\\n\\n### EXPLAINING MENDEL'S RESULTS\\n\\n- Each feature is controlled by a gene, which is found on a chromosome.\\n- There are two copies of each chromosome and each gene in all body cells, except the gametes.\\n- The gametes have only one copy of each chromosome and each gene (i.e. one allele).\\n- There are two alleles of each gene.\\n- One allele is dominant over the other allele, which is recessive.\\n- When two different alleles (one dominant and one recessive) are in the same cell, only the dominant allele is expressed (shown in the appearance of the organism).\\n- An individual can have two dominant alleles, two recessive alleles or a dominant allele and a recessive allele in each cell.\\n\\n### KEY POINT\",\n",
       "  '### KEY POINT\\n\\nNormally, we use the first letter of the dominant feature to represent the gene, with a capital letter indicating the dominant allele and a lower case letter the recessive allele. Tall is dominant to dwarf in pea plants, so we use T for the allele for tall and t for dwarf.\\n\\nWe can use the cross between tall and dwarf pea plants as an example (Figure 18.4). In pea plants, there are tall and dwarf alleles of the gene for height. We will use the symbol T for the tall allele and t for the dwarf allele. The term genotype describes the alleles each cell has for a certain feature (e.g. TT). The phenotype is the feature that results from the genotype (e.g. a tall plant).\\n\\n| phenotype of parents | tall | dwarf |\\n|----------------------|------|-------|\\n| genotype of parents  | TT   | tt    |\\n\\nBoth parents are pure breeding. The tall parent has two alleles for tallness in each cell. The dwarf parent has two alleles for dwarfness in each cell. Because each has two copies of just one allele, we say that they are homozygous for the height gene.\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\n\\nIt is the accepted practice in genetics diagrams to show the gene present in a gamete as a letter in a circle.\\n\\n| gametes (sex cells) | T | t |\\n|---------------------|---|---|',\n",

The name given for inheritance involving one gene is monohybrid inheritance. It is possible to draw genetic diagrams involving two or more genes (e.g height and flower colour together), but for International GCSE you only need to interpret monohybrid crosses.\\n\\nIt is important to remember that in genetic crosses, ratios such as 3:1 are predicted ratios. In breeding experiments the actual numbers of offspring are unlikely to exactly fit a 3:1 ratio.\\n\\nImagine you flip a coin 20 times. The most likely outcome is that you will get 10 heads and 10 tails. However, you wouldn't be surprised to get, by chance, 11 heads and 9 tails, or 8 heads and 12 tails. The same principle applies to the outcome of a breeding experiment.\",\n",
       "  \"For example, one of Mendel's experiments produced 787 tall plants and 277 dwarf plants. This is a ratio of 2.84:1, not quite the expected 3:1. The reason for this is that there are a number of factors that affect survival of the plants – some pollen may not fertilise some ova, some seedlings may die before they mature, and so on. These are unpredictable or 'chance' events. The numbers that Mendel found were statistically close enough to the expected 3:1 ratio, and he found the same thing when he repeated his experiments with other characteristics.\\n\\n## WORKING OUT GENOTYPES – THE TEST CROSS\\n\\nYou cannot tell just by looking at a tall pea plant whether it is homozygous (TT) or heterozygous (Tt). Both these genotypes would appear equally tall because the tall allele is dominant.\\n\\nIt would help if you knew the genotypes of its parents. You could then write out a genetic cross and perhaps work out the genotype of your tall plant. If you don't know the genotypes of the parents, the only way you can find out is by carrying out a breeding experiment called a test cross.\",\n",
       "  \"In a test cross, the factor under investigation is the unknown genotype of an organism showing the dominant phenotype. A tall pea plant could have the genotype TT or Tt. You must control every other possible variable including the genotype of the plant you breed it with. The only genotype you can be certain of is the genotype of plants showing the recessive phenotype (in this case dwarf plants). They must have the genotype tt.\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\n\\nIn a test cross, you breed an organism showing the dominant feature with one showing the recessive feature.\\n\\nIn this example, you must breed the 'unknown' tall pea plant (TT or Tt) with a dwarf pea plant (tt). You can write out a genetic cross for both possibilities (TT × tt and Tt × tt) and predict the outcome for each (Figure 18.5). You can then compare the result of the breeding experiment with the predicted outcome, to see which result matches the prediction most closely.\\n\\n| genotypes of parents | TT | tt | or | Tt | tt |\\n|----------------------|----|----|----|----|----| \\n| gametes | T | t | or | T and t | t |\\n| | | | | T | Tt |\\n| | | | | t | tt |\\n| genotypes of F₁ | all Tt | | or | 1 Tt : 1 tt |\\n| phenotypes of F₁ | all tall | | or | 50% tall and 50% dwarf |\\n\\nFigure 18.5 A test cross\\n\\nFrom our crosses we would expect:\",\n",

It is determined by the X and Y chromosomes – the sex chromosomes. As well as the 44 non-sex chromosomes, there are two X chromosomes in all cells of females (except the egg cells) and one X and one Y chromosome in all cells of males (except the sperm). Our sex is effectively determined by the presence or absence of the Y chromosome. The full chromosome complement of male and female is shown in Figure 16.4 on page 198.\\n\\nThe inheritance of sex follows the pattern shown in Figure 18.9. In any one family, however, this ratio may well not be met. Predicted genetic ratios are usually only met when large numbers are involved.

The reason for this is that it is easier to draw genetics diagrams and explain what is happening if we start by considering alleles of a single gene. However, many characteristics are controlled by two or more genes working together. This is called polygenic inheritance.\\n\\nA good example is human skin colour. Darker skins contain greater amounts of a black pigment called melanin. This is controlled by several genes, which act together to determine the amount of melanin in the skin. Each gene has alleles that promote melanin production and alleles which do not. This produces a wide range of phenotypes (Figure 18.10).\\n\\n### DID YOU KNOW?\",\n",

This has happened by a process called natural selection. This chapter looks at natural selection, as well as traditional methods of selective breeding and modern developments involving cloned organisms.\\n\\n## LEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n- Explain Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection\\n- Understand how resistance to antibiotics can increase in bacterial populations\\n- Understand how selective breeding can be used to produce plants with desired characteristics\\n- Understand how selective breeding can be used to produce animals with desirable characteristics\\n\\nThe meaning of 'evolution' is that species of animals and plants are not fixed in their form, but change over time. It is not a new idea. For thousands of years philosophers have discussed this theory. By the beginning of the nineteenth century there was overwhelming evidence for evolution, and many scientists had accepted that it had taken place. What was missing was an understanding of the mechanism by which evolution could have occurred.\",\n",
       "  \"The person who proposed the mechanism for evolution that is widely accepted today was the English biologist Charles Darwin (Figure 19.1). He called the mechanism natural selection.\\n\\n## THE WORK OF CHARLES DARWIN\\n\\nCharles Darwin was the son of a country doctor. He did not do particularly well at school or university and was unable to decide on a profession. His father is supposed to have said: 'you're good for nothing but shooting guns and rat-catching ... you'll be a disgrace to yourself and all of your family'. He was wrong – Darwin went on to become one of the most famous scientists of all time!\\n\\nAt the age of 22, Charles Darwin became the unpaid biologist aboard the survey ship HMS Beagle, which left England for a five-year voyage in 1831 (Figure 19.2).\\n\\nFigure 19.2 The five-year journey of HMS Beagle:\",\n",

Fossils are formed when minerals replace the materials in bone and tissue, creating a replica of the original organism in the rock.\\n\\nDuring the voyage, Darwin collected hundreds of specimens and made many observations about the variety of organisms and the ways in which they were adapted to their environments. He gained much information, in particular, from the variety of life forms in South America and the Galapagos Islands. Darwin was influenced by the work of Charles Lyell who was, at the time, laying the foundations of modern geology. Lyell was using the evidence of rock layers to suggest that the surface of the Earth was constantly changing. The layers of sediments in rocks represented different time periods. Darwin noticed that the fossils found in successive layers of rocks often changed slightly through the layers. He suggested that life forms were continually changing – evolving.',\n",
       "  \"On his return to England, Darwin began to evaluate his data and wrote several essays, introducing the ideas of natural selection. He arrived at his theory of natural selection from observations made during his voyage on HMS Beagle and from deductions made from those observations. Darwin's observations were that:\\n\\n- organisms generally produce more offspring than are needed to replace them – a single female salmon can release 5 million eggs per year; a giant puffball fungus produces 40 million spores\\n- despite this over-reproduction, stable, established populations of organisms generally remain the same size – the seas are not overflowing with salmon, and we are not surrounded by lots of giant puffball fungi!\\n- members of the same species are not identical – they show variation.\\n\\nHe made two important deductions from these observations.\",\n",
       "  \"He made two important deductions from these observations.\\n\\n- From the first two observations he deduced that there is a 'struggle for existence'. Many offspring are produced, yet the population stays the same size. There must be competition for resources and many individuals must die.\\n- From the third observation he deduced that, if some offspring survive while others die, those organisms best suited to their environment would survive to reproduce. Those less suited will die. This gave rise to the phrase 'survival of the fittest'.\\n\\n### KEY POINT\\n\\nThe phrase 'survival of the fittest' does not mean physical fitness, but biological fitness. This depends on how well adapted an organism is to its environment so that it is successful in reproducing. A good way of putting it is; 'survival of the individuals that will leave most offspring in later generations'.\",\n",
       "  'Notice a key phrase in the second deduction – the best-suited organisms survive to reproduce. This means that those characteristics that give the organism a better chance of surviving will be passed on to the next generation. Fewer of the individuals that are less suited to the environment survive to reproduce. The next generation will have more of the type that is better adapted and fewer of the less well adapted type. This will be repeated in each generation.\\n\\nAnother naturalist, Alfred Russell Wallace, had also studied life forms in South America and Indonesia and had reached the same conclusions as Darwin. Darwin and Wallace published a scientific paper on natural selection jointly, although it was Darwin who went on to develop the ideas further. In 1859, he published his now famous book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (usually shortened to The Origin of Species).\\n\\nThis book changed forever the way in which biologists think about how species originate. Darwin went on to suggest that humans could have evolved from ape-like ancestors. For this he was ridiculed, largely by people who had misunderstood his ideas (Figure 19.3). He also carried out considerable research in other areas of biology, such as plant tropisms (see Chapter 12).',\n",
       "  \"Figure 19.3 Darwin's ideas were unpopular and many newspapers of the time made fun of them.\\n---\\n## VARIATION AND SELECTION\\n\\n### NATURAL SELECTION, EVOLUTION AND SELECTIVE BREEDING\\n\\n#### KEY POINT\\n\\nWhen Darwin proposed his theory of natural selection, he did not know about genes and how they control characteristics. Gregor Mendel had yet to publish his work on inheritance, and as you have seen, the significance of Mendel's work was not recognised until 1903.\\n\\nThe theory of natural selection proposes that some factor in the environment 'selects' which forms of a species will survive to reproduce. Forms that are not well adapted will not survive.\\n\\nThe following is a summary of how we think natural selection works:\\n\\n1. there is variation within the species\\n2. changing conditions in the environment (called a selection pressure) favours one particular form of the species (which has a selective advantage)\\n3. the frequency of the favoured form increases (it is selected for) under these conditions (survival of the fittest)\\n4. the frequency of the less well adapted form decreases under these conditions (it is selected against).\",\n",
       "  \"As you have seen, many gene mutations are harmful, and cells that carry them will not usually survive. Some mutations are 'neutral' and if they arise in the gametes, may be passed on without affecting the survival of the offspring. However, a few mutations can actually be beneficial to an organism. Beneficial mutations are the 'raw material' that are ultimately the source of new inherited variation.\\n\\n### SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW NATURAL SELECTION MIGHT HAVE WORKED\\n\\n#### THE HOVERFLY\\n\\nFigure 19.4 shows two species of insect: a wasp and a hoverfly. Wasps can defend themselves against predators using a sting. They also have a body with yellow and black stripes. This is called a 'warning colouration'. Predators such as birds soon learn that these colours mean that wasps have the sting, and they avoid attacking them.\\n\\nHoverflies do not have a sting. However, they have an appearance that is very like a wasp, with similar yellow and black stripes – they are 'mimics' of wasps. Predators treat hoverflies as if they do have a sting.\\n\\nClearly, mimicking a wasp is an advantage to the hoverfly. How could they have evolved this appearance? We can explain how it could have happened by natural selection.\",\n",
       "  \"Clearly, mimicking a wasp is an advantage to the hoverfly. How could they have evolved this appearance? We can explain how it could have happened by natural selection.\\n\\nThe selection pressure was predation by birds and other animals. Among the ancestors of present-day hoverflies there would have been variation in colours. As a result of mutations, some hoverflies gained genes that produced stripes on their bodies. These insects were less likely to be eaten by predators than hoverflies without the stripes – they had a selective advantage.\\n\\nSince the hoverflies with stripes were more likely to survive being eaten, they were more likely to reproduce, and would pass on the genes for stripes to their offspring. This process continued over many generations. Gradually more mutations and selection for 'better' stripes took place, until the hoverflies evolved the excellent warning colouration that they have today.\\n\\n#### KEY POINT\\n\\nNote that perfect stripes didn't have to appear straight away. Even a slight stripy appearance could give a small selective advantage over hoverflies without stripes. This would be enough to result in an increase in stripy hoverflies in the next generation.\\n---\\n# VARIATION AND SELECTION\\n\\n## NATURAL SELECTION, EVOLUTION AND SELECTIVE BREEDING\",\n",

It also silently approaches and attacks seals that are resting on the ice.\\n\\nPolar bears have many adaptations that suit them to their habitat. These include:',\n",
       "  \"Polar bears have many adaptations that suit them to their habitat. These include:\\n\\n- a thick layer of white fur, which reduces heat loss and acts as camouflage in the snow\\n- wide, large paws. These help with walking in the snow, and are used for swimming\\n- strong, muscular legs – a bear can swim continuously in the cold Arctic waters for days\\n- nostrils that close when the bear is swimming under water\\n- a large body mass. Polar bears are the largest bears on Earth. An adult male averages 350 to 550 kilograms, and the record is over 1000 kilograms. This large size results in the animal having a small surface area to volume ratio, which reduces heat loss\\n- a 10 centimetre thick layer of insulating fat under the skin\\n- a well developed sense of smell – used to detect the bear's prey\\n- bumps on the pads of the paws to provide grip on the ice\\n- short, powerful claws, which also provide grip, and are needed for holding the heavy prey.\\n\\nThe polar bear is thought to have evolved from a smaller species, the brown bear, about 150,000 years ago. How did it evolve its adaptations for life in the Arctic? Let's consider just one of the adaptations, the thick white fur.\",\n",
       "  'There are two main selection pressures in favour of thick white fur. The first is the need for insulation to reduce heat loss. The polar bear often has to survive temperatures of -30°C, and temperatures in the Arctic can fall as low as -70°C. The second is camouflage; white fur camouflages the animal against the snow so that it can approach its prey unseen and then attack it.\\n\\nAmong the brown bears that were the ancestors of the polar bear there would have been variations in fur length and colour. When some of these bears came to live in colder, more northerly habitats, those individuals with longer and paler fur would have had a selective advantage over others with shorter, darker fur. Any gene mutations that produced long, pale fur increased this advantage. Bears with these genes were less likely to die from the cold, or from lack of food. As a result, well-adapted bears were more likely to reproduce and pass on their genes. Over many thousands of years more mutations and selection for long, white fur produced the adaptation we see in the polar bear today. The same process of natural selection is thought to have happened to bring about the other adaptations shown by the polar bear.\\n\\n### DID YOU KNOW?',\n",
       "  '### DID YOU KNOW?\\n\\nPolar bear fur appears to be white, but in fact the individual hairs are actually transparent. The white colour results from light being refracted through the clear hair strands.\\n\\n### CAN WE OBSERVE NATURAL SELECTION IN ACTION?\\n\\nMost animals and plants reproduce slowly, so it takes a long time for natural selection to have an observable effect. To observe natural selection happening we can study organisms that reproduce quickly, such as bacteria or insects.\\n---\\n## ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE IN BACTERIA\\n\\nAntibiotics are chemicals that kill or reduce the growth of microorganisms (Figure 19.6). They are used in medicine mainly to treat bacterial infections, although a few antibiotics are effective against fungal pathogens. Antibiotics do not work on viruses, so they are no use in treating any disease caused by a virus.\\n\\nNatural antibiotics are produced by bacteria and fungi. They give a microorganism an advantage over other microorganisms when competing for nutrients and other resources, since the antibiotic kills the competing organisms.',\n",
       "  'Alexander Fleming discovered the first antibiotic in 1929. It is made by the mould Penicillium, and is called penicillin. Penicillin kills bacteria, and was first used to treat bacterial infections in the 1940s. Since then other natural antibiotics have been discovered, and many more have been chemically synthesised in laboratories. The use of antibiotics has increased dramatically, particularly over the last 20 years. We now almost expect to be given an antibiotic for even the most minor of ailments. This can be dangerous, as it leads to the development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, so that the antibiotics are no longer effective in preventing bacterial infection.\\n\\nFigure 19.6 This photo shows a colony of bacteria growing on a petri dish of nutrient agar. The circular discs contain different antibiotics. The discs have clear areas around them, where the bacteria have been killed by the antibiotic diffusing out from the discs.\\n\\n### DID YOU KNOW?',\n",
       "  \"### DID YOU KNOW?\\n\\nA particularly worrying example of a resistant bacterium is MRSA. MRSA stands for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. It is sometimes called a 'super bug' because it is resistant to many antibiotics including methicillin (a type of penicillin). It is a particular problem in hospitals where it is responsible for many difficult-to-treat infections.\\n\\nResistance starts when a random mutation gives a bacterium resistance to a particular antibiotic. In a situation where the antibiotic is widely used, the new resistant bacterium has an advantage over non-resistant bacteria of the same type. The resistant strain of bacterium will survive and multiply in greater numbers than the non-resistant type. Bacteria reproduce very quickly – the generation time of a bacterium (the time it takes to divide into two daughter cells) can be as short as 20 minutes. This means that there could be 72 generations in a single day, producing a population of millions of resistant bacteria.\\n\\nResistant bacteria will not be killed by the antibiotic, meaning the antibiotic is no longer effective in controlling the disease.\",\n",
       "  \"Resistant bacteria will not be killed by the antibiotic, meaning the antibiotic is no longer effective in controlling the disease.\\n\\nBacterial resistance to antibiotics was first noticed in hospitals in the 1950s, and has grown to be a major problem today. The resistant bacteria have a selective advantage over non-resistant bacteria – they are 'fitter'. In effect, the bacteria have evolved as a result of natural selection.\\n\\nDoctors are now more reluctant to prescribe antibiotics. They know that by using them less, the bacteria with resistance have less of an advantage and will not become as widespread.\\n\\n### HINT\\n\\nSome people talk about bacteria becoming immune to antibiotics. This is a misunderstanding. Immunity happens in people – we become immune to microorganisms that infect us, as a result of the immune response. Bacteria become resistant to antibiotics.\\n\\n## PESTICIDE RESISTANCE IN INSECTS\",\n",
       "  '## PESTICIDE RESISTANCE IN INSECTS\\n\\nJust as pathogenic bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics, insect pests can develop resistance to insecticides. The powerful insecticide DDT was first used in the 1940s (see Chapter 15). By the 1950s many species of insect (e.g. mosquitoes) appeared to be resistant to DDT. The resistant insects had developed a gene mutation that stopped them being killed by the insecticide.\\n---\\nWhile DDT continued to be used, the resistant insects had a selective advantage over the non-resistant ones. They survived to breed, so that with each generation the numbers of resistant insects in the population increased.\\n\\nThe same thing has happened with modern insecticides. There are now hundreds of examples of insect pests that have developed resistance to different insecticides.\\n\\n## SELECTIVE BREEDING\\n\\nAbout 12000 years ago, the human way of life changed significantly. Humans began to grow plants and keep animals for milk and meat. They became farmers rather than hunters. This change first took place in the Middle East. Similar changes took place a little later in the Americas (where potatoes and maize were being grown) and in the Far East (where rice was first cultivated).',\n",
       "  \"In the Middle East, humans first grew the cereal plants wheat and barley, and kept sheep and goats. Later, their livestock included cattle and pigs. Cultivating crops and keeping stock animals made it possible for permanent settlements to appear – life in villages began. Because of the more certain food supply, there was spare time, for the first time ever, for some people to do things other than hunt for food.\\n\\nEver since the cultivation of the first wheat and barley and the domestication of the first stock animals, humans have tried to obtain bigger yields from them. They cross-bred different maize plants (and barley plants) to obtain strains that produced more grain. They bred sheep and goats to give more milk and meat – selective breeding had begun. Today, animals and plants are bred for more than just food. For example, animals are used to produce a range of medicines and for research into the action of drugs.\\n\\nSelective breeding is best described as the breeding of only those individuals with desirable features. It is sometimes called 'artificial selection', as human choice, rather than environmental factors, is providing the selection pressure (compare this with natural selection, described above).\",\n",
       "  'The methods used today for selective breeding are very different from those used only 50 years ago. Modern gene technology makes it possible to create a new strain of plant within weeks, rather than years.\\n\\n## TRADITIONAL SELECTIVE BREEDING\\n\\n### PLANTS\\n\\nTraditionally, farmers have bred crop plants of all kinds to obtain increased yields. Probably the earliest example of selective breeding was the cross-breeding of strains of wild wheat. The aim was to produce wheat with a much increased yield of grain and with shorter, stronger stems (Figure 19.7). This wheat was used to make bread.',\n",
       "  \"| Stage | Description | Wheat Type |\\n|-------|-------------|------------|\\n| 1 | About 11,000 years ago, two strains of wild wheat were cultivated by farmers. Initially, all attempts at cross-breeding to produce wheats with a better yield gave only sterile offspring. | Triticum monococcum (wild einkorn wheat) - unknown wild wheat |\\n| 2 | About 8000 years ago, a fertile hybrid wheat appeared from these two wild wheats. This was called emmer wheat and had a much higher yield than either of the original wheats. | Fertile hybrid wheat - Triticum turgidum (wild emmer wheat) |\\n| 3 | The emmer wheat was cross-bred with another wild wheat to produce wheat very similar to the wheats used today to make bread. This new wheat had an even bigger yield and was much easier to 'process' to make flour. | Triticum aestivum (bread wheat) |\\n\\nFigure 19.7 Modern wheat is the result of selective breeding by early farmers.\\n---\\n## VARIATION AND SELECTION\\n\\n### NATURAL SELECTION, EVOLUTION AND SELECTIVE BREEDING\",\n",

Each original wild wheat species had 14 chromosomes per cell. The wild emmer hybrid had 28 chromosomes per cell. Modern bread wheat has 42 chromosomes per cell. Selective breeding has modified the genetic make-up of wheat.\\n\\nOther plants have been selectively bred for certain characteristics. Brassica is a genus of cabbage-like plants. One species of wild brassica (Brassica olera) was selectively bred to give several strains, each with specific features (see Figure 19.8).

A stone tablet found in Iran appears to record the results of breeding domesticated donkeys. It was dated at over 5000 years old.\\n\\nFor many thousands of years, the only way to improve livestock was to mate a male and a female with the features that were desired in the offspring. In cattle, milk yield is an important factor and so high-yielding cows would be bred with bulls from other high-yielding cows.',\n",
       "  \"Since about 1950, the technique of artificial insemination (AI) has become widely available. Bulls with many desirable features are kept and semen is obtained from them. The semen is diluted, frozen and stored. Farmers can buy quantities of this semen to inseminate their cows. The semen is transferred into the cow's uterus using a syringe. AI makes it possible for the semen from one prize bull to be used to fertilise many thousands of cows.\\n\\nModern sheep are domesticated wild sheep, and cows have been derived from wild aurochs.

       "  'Fermentation and fermenters are terms that you will encounter if you are involved in the growth of microorganisms. What do these words mean? Many microorganisms respire anaerobically (see Chapter 1), and originally, fermentation meant any anaerobic respiration process involving microorganisms, such as the fermentation of sugars by yeast. Nowadays, the word is used more generally to define other metabolic processes carried out by microorganisms, many of which are aerobic. Fermentation is normally used to make a useful product.\\n\\nThis overlaps with the definition of biotechnology, which means using any organisms (but mainly microbes) to make products that are useful to humans. Although the word itself is relatively new, humans have been using biotechnology processes for thousands of years without knowing it. Since ancient times, fermentation by yeast has been used to produce bread. Yoghurt is made by the action of bacteria on milk, and other bacteria and moulds are used in cheese manufacture.',\n",

Nowadays we understand what is happening when fermentation takes place, and can use biotechnology to produce not just foods but also a huge range of products, from medicines like penicillin to chemicals such as enzymes and fuels.\\n\\nModern biotechnology also allows us to alter the genes of microorganisms so that they code for new products.

Commercial wine production takes place in large containers called vats which prevent air reaching the wine and ensure conditions remain anaerobic. Homemade wine is produced in small-scale fermenters fitted with an 'airlock', which allows carbon dioxide to escape but prevents the entry of oxygen (Figure 20.2). The alcohol increases in concentration until it kills the yeast cells, at which point fermentation stops.\\n\\nBeer is made from barley. Barley contains starch rather than sugars so the starch needs to be broken down first. This happens by allowing the barley seeds to germinate. When they start to germinate they produce the enzyme amylase, which breaks down starch into the sugar maltose. Amylase breaks down starch into the sugar maltose. Later, the maltose from the seeds is fermented by yeast in a large open vat (Figure 20.3).\\n---\\nMICROORGANISMS AND GENETIC MODIFICATION | USING MICROORGANISMS\",\n",

Wheat flour and water are mixed together and yeast added, forming the bread dough. Enzymes from the original cereal grains break down starch to sugars, which are respired by the yeast. Extra sugar may be added at this stage. In bread-making, the yeast begins by respiring aerobically, producing water and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide makes the dough rise. When the air runs out, conditions become anaerobic, so the yeast begins to respire anaerobically making ethanol and more carbon dioxide.\\n\\nLater, when the dough is baked in the oven, the gas bubbles expand. This gives the bread a light, cellular texture (Figure 20.4). Baking also kills the yeast cells and evaporates any ethanol from the fermentation.',\n",

The methods used to prevent contamination by unwanted microorganisms such as filtering the air and sterilising the fermenter using steam, are known as 'aseptic precautions'.\\n---\\n                motor\\n                  |\\nsteam inlet ---->[|]\\ninlet 'X' ----->[|]    acid/alkali ---> steam outlet\\nPenicillium -->[|]     inlet       ---> exhaust outlet\\ninlet           |\\n                |\\n                |      cold water outlet\\n                |             |\\n         +------+------+      |\\n         |             |      |\\ncold     |     [ ]     |<---- stirring paddle\\nwater    |     [ ]     |\\njacket   |     [ ]     |\\n         |     [ ]     |\\n         |      _      |\\ncold     |     |_|     |\\nwater    +-------------+\\ninlet --->      |\\n                |\\n         air inlet\\n           |\\n        [filter]\\n           |\\n        outlet for harvesting penicillin\\n\\n---\\n244 MICROORGANISMS AND GENETIC MODIFICATION | USING MICROORGANISMS\\n\\nSKILLS CRITICAL THINKING\",\n",

One strand of the DNA (called the coding strand) contains triplets of bases, each triplet coding for one amino acid. Different genes produce different proteins because each has a unique sequence of bases that codes for a unique sequence of amino acids (Figure 21.1).\\n\\nG G A T G C C G A T A C G\\n\\n---\\nA T\\nC G\\nG C\\nA T\\nA T\\nT A\\nT A\\nC G\\nC G\\nT A\\nG C\\nC G\\nG C\\nT A\\nA T\\nT A\\nT A\\nG C\\nG C\\nA T\",\n",

A section of DNA – a gene – is cut out of the DNA of one species and inserted into the DNA of another. This new DNA is called 'recombinant' DNA because the DNA from two different organisms has been 'recombined'.

The DNA is heated to separate the strands and the primers added to the ends of each strand. An enzyme called DNA polymerase builds up two new complimentary strands by adding nucleotides - one at a time - along each strand.\\n\\nNowadays, PCR is an automated process and can be performed in as little as 2-3 hours in a PCR machine. You just place small tubes containing the DNA sample, primers, free nucleotides, DNA polymerase and a buffer solution in the machine, switch on, and wait for the results.\\n---\\n254 MICROORGANISMS AND GENETIC MODIFICATION        GENETIC MODIFICATION',\n",

However, sometimes a cell needs to take in a substance when there is very little of that substance outside the cell, in other words against a concentration gradient.

      "- The concentration gradient. Diffusion happens more quickly when there is a steep concentration gradient (i.e. a big difference in concentrations between two areas).\n",
      "- The surface area to volume ratio. A larger surface area in proportion to the volume will increase the rate.\n",
      "- The distance. The rate is decreased if the distance over which diffusion has to take place is greater.\n",
